# Playbooks

Playbooks are a series of tasks, conditions, scripts, conditions, commands, and loops that run in a predefined flow to save time and improve efficiency and results of the investigation and response process.

Playbooks enable you to automate complex workflows in Cortex XSIAM without requiring complicated coding, and they are created and edited directly in the UI via the Playbook Editor. For more information, see [Playbooks](https://app.gitbook.com/s/AEIjuYE3RXcIfmuQnBbm/).

After the playbook is complete, it can be downloaded and added to a content pack for submission.

Playbooks can be triggered by:

*   Issues

    Playbooks can run automatically for incoming issues by issue type. Consider whether your content pack needs a new issue type.

    Add a trigger to run a playbook for an issue with specific characteristics. For example, set a condition based on the issue source, severity, or MITRE TTP. For more information, see Playbook triggers.
*   Indicator queries

    TIM playbooks can run based on indicator queries. Determine what indicator query (for example, all IP indicators retrieved from a particular feed) should be used.
*   Sub-playbooks

    A parent playbook can invoke a sub-playbook. If you use sub-playbooks, consider what inputs and outputs your playbook should support and determine the default values. See the Cortex XSIAM **Playbook Design Guide** for more details.
