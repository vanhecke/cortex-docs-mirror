# Use NGINX as a reverse proxy

NGINX can act as a reverse proxy that sits between internal applications and external clients, forwarding client requests to the appropriate application. Using NGINX as a reverse proxy in front of the engine enables you to provide network segmentation where the proxy can be put on a public subnet (DMZ) while the engine can be on a private subnet, only accepting traffic from the proxy. Additionally, NGINX provides a number of advanced load balancing and acceleration features that you can utilize.

If you want to use an engine (d1) through the reverse proxy, you need to modify `EngineURLs` in the `d1.conf` file to point to the host and port the NGINX server is listening on. In addition to supporting engine upgrades from the UI, edit the `/usr/local/demisto/upgrade.conf` file to add the `SERVER_URLS` setting. `SERVER_URLS` should be set to the proxy’s network address (host and port). For example: `SERVER_URLS="10.0.0.30:1234"`. For SERVER\_URLS, include only the IP/hostname and, optionally, a port. Do not include https:// or any path at the end.

<summary>Install NGINX</summary>

You can install NGINX on the Red Hat/Amazon (yum) and Ubuntu Linux distributions. For full instructions and available distributions, see [NGINX documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-open-source/).

1. On the engine, run one of the following commands according to your Linux system:
   * **RedHat/Amazon:** **`sudo yum install nginx`**
   * **Ubuntu:** **`sudo apt-get install nginx`**
2.  (Optional) Verify the NGINX installation by running the following command:

    **`sudo nginx -v`**

<summary>Generate a certificate for NGINX</summary>

You should not use self-signed certificates for production systems. It is recommended to use a properly signed certificate for production systems. These instructions are intended only for non-production setups.

1.  To use OpenSSL to generate a self-signed certificate, on the engine machine, run the following command:

    **`sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/nginx/cert.key -out /etc/nginx/cert.crt`**
2. When prompted, complete the on-screen instructions to complete the required fields.

<summary>Configure NGINX</summary>

1.  Open the following NGINX configuration file with your preferred editor:

    `/etc/nginx/conf.d/demisto.conf`
2.  Use the following configuration template:

    Replace **`DEMISTO_ENGINE`** with the appropriate hostname.

    ```programlisting
    # Replace DEMISTO_ENGINE with the appropriate hostname. If needed, change port 443 to the port on which the engine is listening.

    upstream demisto {
        server DEMISTO_ENGINE:443;
    }

    # Uncomment to redirect http to https (optional)
    # server {
    #     listen 80;
    #     return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    # }

    server {
       # Change the port if you want NGINX to listen on a different port
        listen 443;
        
        ssl_certificate           /etc/nginx/cert.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key       /etc/nginx/cert.key;

        ssl on;
        ssl_session_cache  builtin:1000  shared:SSL:10m;
        ssl_protocols  TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
        ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!CAMELLIA:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4;
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

        access_log            /var/log/nginx/demisto.access.log;

        location / {

          proxy_set_header        Host $host;
          proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
          proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
          proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

          proxy_pass          https://demisto;
          proxy_read_timeout  90;
        }

        location ~ ^/(websocket|d1ws|d2ws) {
            proxy_pass https://demisto;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header Origin "";
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }
    ```

    <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="info" class="hint hint-info"><p>For multi-tenant deployments, replace <strong><code>location ~ ^/(websocket|d1ws|d2ws) {</code></strong> with <strong><code>location ~ ^/(acc_\S+/)?(websocket|d1ws|d2ws)</code></strong></p></div>
3.  Restart the NGINX server by typing the following command:

    **`sudo service nginx restart`**
4. Verify you can access the engine by browsing to the NGINX server host.
