# Docker hardening guide

The following describes the engine settings we recommend for securely running Docker containers.

When editing the configuration file, you can limit container resources, open file descriptors, limit available CPU, and more. For example, add the following keys to the configuration file:

`{"docker.run.internal.asuser": true,"limit.docker.cpu": true,"limit.docker.memory": true,"python.pass.extra.keys": "--pids-limit=256##--ulimit=nofile=1024:8192"}`

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend reviewing _Docker network hardening_ below before changing any parameters in the configuration file.
{% endhint %}

To securely run Docker containers, we recommend using the latest Docker version.

You can _Check Docker Hardening Configurations_ to verify that the Docker container has been hardened according to the settings we recommend.

{% hint style="info" %}
The settings below can also be applied to Podman, with the exception of limiting available memory, limiting available CPU, and limiting PIDS.
{% endhint %}
