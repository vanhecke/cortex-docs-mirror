# Compute units usage

Cortex XSIAM provides a free daily quota of compute units (CU) allocated according to your license size. Queries called without enough quota will fail. To expand your investigation capabilities, you can purchase additional CU by enabling the Compute Unit add-on. After purchasing the additional CU, you can enable the add-on by selecting **Settings → Cortex XSIAM License → Addons**, hovering over the **Extended Compute Units** tile and clicking **Enable**.

\
The Compute Unit add-on provides an additional 1 compute unit per day for a year, in addition to your free annual quota. For example, if you have allocated 1,825 free annual CU, with the add-on, you will have a total of 2,190 annual compute units. The Compute Unit add-on is calculated on an annual basis, starting from the procurement of your add-on license. The minimum purchase amount is 50 compute units.

You can configure the daily consumption limit for your compute units according to your organizational needs and change it when needed. For example, you can set a lower limit on a daily basis, and during an incident investigation, you can change it to a higher limit that enables you to consume more compute units.

Your unused compute unit balance cannot be transferred from one licensing period to the next.

To gauge how many CU you require, Cortex XSIAM provides a 30-day free trial period with 1/12 of your allocated annual CU quota to run XQL API and Cold Storage queries. You can then track the cost of each XQL API and Cold Storage query response in the **Compute Unit Consumption** page. In addition, Cortex XSIAM sends a notification when the Compute Units add-on has reached your daily threshold.

### View and manage your compute units usage

You can view and manage your compute units usage at **Settings → Configurations → Data Management → Compute Unit Consumption**.

{% hint style="info" %}
### Important

Compute units consumption currently applies only to XQL queries. Agentic and LLM information is shown only for informational purposes and does not consume compute units.
{% endhint %}

#### Widgets

The following widgets present information about your compute units consumption and enable you to manage the daily limit.

{% hint style="info" %}
### NOTE

Widgets include data for agents and LLM usage, but agents and LLM usage does not consume compute units at this time. Data is provided only for informational purposes.
{% endhint %}

The **Total annual usage** widget shows the number of free compute units per license year, the number of purchased compute units per license year, and the ratio of used compute units to your yearly total compute units.

The **Daily limit** widget shows the day’s consumption of compute units. If you have **Edit** permissions for Public APIs, you can click **Set daily limit** to customize the daily limit to meet your organizational needs. The default daily limit is the annual quota divided evenly. For Managed Security tenants, the values calculated are the total daily usage of parent and child tenants.

* **Divide annual quota evenly**: Total annual compute units divided by 365.
* **1% of annual quota**: 1% of the total annual compute units.
* **No limit**
* **Custom**: Configure a daily amount that is equal to or greater than your daily average calculated over a year (annual total/365). Use only integers.

The **Consumption by category over time** widget, by default, displays the last 30 days. You can click individual categories under the graph to filter. You can also change the timeframe to the last 12 months by filtering by timestamp in the **Compute Units Usage** table below.

The daily compute units are calculated at 00:00 UTC time. The red line represents your daily limit for that day. If you change the daily limit multiple times on a specific day, the displayed limit is the last number you configured on that day.\
​\
The **Usage by type default**, by default, displays the last 30 days. You can click individual categories in the graph to filter. You can also change the timeframe to the last 12 months days by filtering by timestamp in the **Compute Units Usage** table below.

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE:** For Managed Security tenants, select a tenant from the MSSP Tenant Selection drop-down menu to display information for that tenant.
{% endhint %}

#### Compute Units Table

In the **Compute Units Usage** table, you can filter all the requests that were executed on your tenant. You can filter and sort according to the following fields:<br>

* **ID**: Unique identifier representing the executed XQL API query or request.
* **Timestamp:** Date and time of execution. For Notebooks and BQ queries, this is the data and time the query is charged.
* **Type**: Indicates the type of request.
* **Trigger/PAPI Key ID**:
  * For API calls: PAPI Key.
  * For manual actions: User.
  * For automated actions: Rule or playbook.
* **Query/Prompt**: The query or prompt.
* **Compute Unit Usage**: How many units were used.
* **Category:** XQL Queries, Agents & LLM.
* **Trigger Type:** The type of source of the query or prompt. For example, automation rule or playbook.
* **Billable:** Whether the query was deducted from your compute units. Requests that are non-billable are displayed for informational purposes and do not affect your daily limit or compute units balance.
* **Tenant:** Appears only in a Managed Security tenant. Displays which tenant executed the query.

### Investigate the XQL API results.

In the **Compute Units Usage** table, locate an XQL API query, right-click, and select **Show results**.

The query is displayed in the query ﬁeld of the Query Builder, where you can view the query results. For more information, see [How to build XQL queries](../../../reference-and-developer-docs/cortex-agentix-xql).
