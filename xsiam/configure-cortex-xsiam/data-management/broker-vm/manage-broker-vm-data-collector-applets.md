### Configuration options available for all Broker VM data collector applets

The following options are available to select for all data collector applets:

* **Configure**: Enables you to redefine the Broker VM data collector configurations.
* **Deactivate**: Disables the Broker VM data collector. Cortex XSIAM provides the ability to maintain the Broker VM applet configurations whenever an applet is deactivated. This ensures that whenever the applet is reactivated the saved configuration is restored. When the dialog box is displayed to confirm deactivating the Broker VM data collector applet, leave the Save applet configuration checkbox selected (default) to maintain the applet configuration; otherwise, if this checkbox is unmarked, the applet configuration is deleted.
* **Update**: Initiates a manual upgrade for the specific applet. This option is only visible in the applet hovering menu when a new version is available.
