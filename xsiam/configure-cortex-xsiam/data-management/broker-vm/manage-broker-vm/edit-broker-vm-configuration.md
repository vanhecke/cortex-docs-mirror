# Edit Broker VM Configuration

After configuring and registering your Broker VM, you can edit existing configurations and define additional settings in the Broker VMs page in the Brokers tab. When you have a high availability (HA) cluster configured, you can also edit any Broker VM nodes configurations in the Clusters tab from the Broker VMs table under the Cluster.

Perform the following procedures in the order listed below.

### Open the Configurations page for the Broker VM

1. Select **Settings** → **Configurations** → **Data Broker** → **Broker VMs**.
2. In the Broker VMs table, locate the Broker VM. Right-click it and select **Configure**.

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Note

If the Broker VM is disconnected, you can only view its configuration.

You can also configure HA cluster nodes from the **Clusters** tab.
{% endhint %}

### Define the settings in the Configurations page

Edit the existing Network Interfaces, Proxy Server, NTP Server, and SSH Access configurations.

<details>

<summary>Device Name (Requires Broker VM 8.0 and later)</summary>

Change the name of your Broker VM device name by selecting the pencil icon. The new name will appear in the Brokers table.

</details>

<details>

<summary>FQDN</summary>

Set your Broker VM FQDN as it will be defined in your Domain Name System (DNS). This enables connection between the WEF and WEC, acting as the subscription manager. The Broker VM FQDN settings affect the WEC and Agent Installer and Content Caching.

</details>

<details>

<summary>(Optional) Internal Network (Requires Broker VM 8.0 and later)</summary>

Specify a network subnet to avoid the Broker VM dockers colliding with your internal network. By default, the Network Subnet is set to `172.17.0.1/16`.

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Note

Internal IP must be:

* Formatted as **`prefix/mask`**, for example **`192.0.2.1/24`**.
* Must be within `/8` to `/24` range.
* Cannot be configured to end with a zero.

For Broker VM version 9.0 and lower, Cortex XSIAM accepts only `172.17.0.0/16`.
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>

<summary>Auto Upgrade</summary>

Enable or Disable automatic upgrade of the Broker VM. By default, auto upgrade is enabled at Any time for all 7 days of the week, but you can also set the Days in Week and Specific time for the automatic upgrades. If you disable auto-upgrade, new features and improvements will require manual upgrade.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Monitoring</summary>

Enable or Disable of local monitoring of the Broker VM usage statistics in Prometheus metrics format, allowing you to tap in and export data by navigating to **`http://<broker_vm_address>:9100/metrics/`**. By default, monitoring your Broker VM is disabled. For more information with an example of how to set up Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the Broker VM, see [Monitor Broker VM using Prometheus](monitor-broker-vm-using-prometheus).

</details>

<details>

<summary>(Optional) SSH Access</summary>

**Broker VM 7.4.5 and earlier**

Enable/Disable ssh Palo Alto Networks support team SSH access by using a Cortex XSIAM token.

Enabling allows Palo Alto Networks support team to connect to the Broker VM remotely, not the customer, with the generated password. If you use SSL decryption in your firewalls, you need to add a trusted self-signed CA certificate on the Broker VM to prevent any difficulties with SSL decryption. For example, when [configuring Palo Alto Networks NGFW to decrypt SSL](https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000ClmyCAC) using a self-signed certificate, you need to ensure the Broker VM can validate a self-signed CA by uploading the `cert_ssl-decrypt.crt` file on the Broker VM.

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Note

Make sure you save the password before closing the window. The only way to re-generate a password is to disable ssh and re-enable.
{% endhint %}

**Broker VM 14.0.42 and later**

Customize the login banner displayed, when logging into SSH sessions on the Broker VM in the Welcome Message field by overwriting the default welcome message with a new one added in the field. When the field is empty, the default message is used.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Broker UI Password</summary>

Reset your current Broker VM Web UI password. Define and Confirm your new password. Password must be at least 8 characters.

</details>

<details>

<summary>(Optional) SSL Server Certificate section (Requires Broker VM 10.1.9 and later)</summary>

Upload your signed server certificate and key to establish a validated secure SSL connection between your endpoints and the Broker VM. When you configure the server certificate and the key files in the tenant UI, Cortex XSIAM automatically updates them in the Broker VM UI, even when the Broker VM UI is disabled.

Cortex XSIAM validates that the certificate and key match, but does not validate the Certificate Authority (CA).

When you are done, Save your changes.
