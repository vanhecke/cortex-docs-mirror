# Monitor datasets and dataset views activity

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Prerequisite

Dataset Management requires **View/Edit** RBAC permissions for **Data Management** (under **Configurations** → **Data Management**), which are the same permissions required for Parsing Rules, Data Model Rules, and Event Forwarding.
{% endhint %}

Cortex XSIAM logs entries for events related to datasets and dataset views monitored activities. Cortex XSIAM stores the logs for 365 days. To view the datasets and dataset views audit logs, select **Settings** → **Management Audit Logs**.

You can customize your view of the logs by adding or removing filters to the **Management Audit Logs** table. You can also filter the page result to narrow down your search. The following table describes the default and optional fields that you can view in the Cortex XSIAM **Management Audit Logs** table:

### Note

Certain fields are exposed and hidden by default. An asterisk (\*) is beside every field that is exposed by default.
