# Pending cloud instances

In Cortex XSIAM, a pending cloud instance refers to a cloud instance created after Cortex XSIAM generates an authentication template, but before that template has been fully executed within the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) environment.

A pending cloud instance is created each time you complete the onboarding wizard for a new CSP and click **Save**. You can view all cloud instances, including those in a pending state, by navigating to **Cloud Instances**. Ensure you remove any default filters that might exclude instances with a "pending" status.

A single pending instance can be leveraged to create multiple cloud instances, all sharing the same configurations defined during the cloud onboarding process. Pending instances are automatically deleted after 30 days.

**Manage pending cloud instances**

There are some actions that can be performed specifically on cloud instances with a status of "pending".

| Action                          | Instructions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Manually connect an instance    | After the authentication template has been executed in the CSP, you can manually connect the Cortex XSIAM cloud instance to the CSP by right-clicking the pending cloud instance and selecting **Manually connect an instance**. For more about this process, see [Manually connect a cloud instance](../../cloud-service-provider-csp-onboarding/manually-connect-a-cloud-instance). |
| View Details                    | To review the configuration settings defined in the onboarding wizard for a pending instance, right-click the instance and select **View Details**. This is helps you distinguish between pending instances when you want to create a new cloud instance from an existing pending instance or when you want to manually connect an instance.                                          |
| Re-download Connection Template | The authentication template that you download from the onboarding wizard is valid for seven days from when it was downloaded. If you want to create a new cloud instance from a pending instance after the authentication template has expired, you can right-click the pending instance and select Re-download Connection Template. You must then execute the template in the CSP.   |
| Delete                          | To delete a pending instance, right-click the pending instance and select **Delete**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
