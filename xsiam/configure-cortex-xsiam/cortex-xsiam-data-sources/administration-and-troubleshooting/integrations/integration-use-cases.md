# Integration use cases

The following categories are common use cases for Cortex XSIAM integrations. While this list is not meant to be exhaustive, it's a starting point to understand what use cases are supported by Cortex XSIAM and third-party integrations.

<details>

<summary>Analytics and SIEM</summary>

Top use cases:

* Fetch issues with relevant filters.
* Create, close, and delete issues/events/cases.
* Update issues - update status, assignees, severity, SLA, and more.
* Get events related to an issue/case for enrichment/investigation purposes.
* Query SIEM (consider aggregating logs).

These integrations usually include the Fetch Issues or Fetch Alerts option for an integration instance configuration. The integration may also include integration commands enabling you to list or retrieve issues or related information.

Analytics & SIEM integration Example: ArcSight ESM

<summary>Authentication and Identity Management</summary>

Top use cases:

* Use credentials from the authentication vault to configure instances in Cortex XSIAM. (Save credentials in: Settings → **Configurations** → Integrations → **Credentials**.) Integrations that use credentials from the vault should have the **Switch to credentials** option.
* Lock/Delete Account – Use an integration to lock/unlock a third-party account.
* Reset Account - Perform a reset password command for a third-party account.
* Lock an external credentials vault - in case of an emergency (if the vault has been compromised), allow the option to lock/unlock the entire vault via an integration.
* Step-Up authentication - Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication for an account.
* Create, update, and delete users.
* Manage user groups.
* Block users, force a change of passwords.
* Manage access to resources and applications.
* Create, update, and delete roles.

<summary>Data Management and Threat Intelligence</summary>

Top use cases:

* Enrich information about different IOC types: Upload object for scan and get the scan results. (If there’s an option to upload private/public, the default should be set to private.) Search for former scan results about an object to get information about a sample without uploading it yourself. Enrich information and scoring for the object.
* Add indicators to the system and search for existing indicators.
* Add indicators to the exclusion list.
* Calculate DBot Score for indicators.
* Enrich asset – get vulnerability information for an asset (or a group of assets) in the organization.
* Generate/trigger a scan on specified assets.
* Get a scan report including vulnerability information for a specified scan and export it.
* Get details for a specified vulnerability.
* Scan assets for a specific vulnerability.

Data Enrichment & Threat Intelligence integration example: Unit 42 Intelligence.
