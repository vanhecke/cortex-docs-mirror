# Ingest network Route 53 logs from Amazon S3

You can forward network AWS Route 53 DNS logs to Cortex XSIAM from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

To receive network Route 53 DNS logs from Amazon S3, you must first configure data collection from Amazon S3. You can then configure the Collection Integrations settings in Cortex XSIAM for Amazon S3. After you set up collection integration, Cortex XSIAM begins receiving new logs and data from the source.

You can configure Amazon S3 with SQS notification using the AWS CloudFormation Script that we have created for you to make the process easier. The instructions below explain how to configure Cortex XSIAM to receive network Route 53 DNS logs from Amazon S3 using SQS.

**Note**

For more information on configuring data collection from Amazon S3 for Route 53 DNS logs, see the [AWS Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/log-your-vpc-dns-queries-with-route-53-resolver-query-logs/).
{% endhint %}

When Cortex XSIAM begins receiving logs, the app automatically creates an Amazon Route 53 Cortex Query Language (XQL) dataset (`amazon_route53_raw`). This enables you to search the logs with XQL Search using the dataset. For example, queries refer to the in-app XQL Library. For enhanced cloud protection, you can also configure Cortex XSIAM to ingest network Route 53 DNS logs as Cortex XSIAM network connection stories, which you can query with XQL Search using the `xdr_data` dataset with the preset called `network_story`. Cortex XSIAM can also generate Cortex XSIAM issues (Analytics, Correlation Rules, IOC, and BIOC) when relevant from Amazon Route 53 DNS logs. While Correlation Rules issues are generated on non-normalized and normalized logs, Analytics, IOC, and BIOC issues are only generated on normalized logs.

Enhanced cloud protection provides:

* Normalization of cloud logs
* Cloud logs stitching
* Enrichment with cloud data
* Detection based on cloud analytics
* Cloud-tailored investigations

Be sure you do the following tasks before you begin configuring data collection from Amazon S3 using the AWS CloudFormation Script.

* Ensure that you have the proper permissions to run AWS CloudFormation with the script provided in Cortex XSIAM. You need at a minimum the following permissions in AWS for an Amazon S3 bucket and Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS):
  * **Amazon S3 bucket**: `GetObject`
  * **SQS**: `ChangeMessageVisibility`, `ReceiveMessage`, and `DeleteMessage`.
* Ensure that you can access your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and have the necessary permissions to create Route 53 Resolver Query logs.
* Determine how you want to provide access to Cortex XSIAM to your logs and perform API operations. You have the following options.
  * Use Workload Federated Identity to allow Cortex XSIAM's dedicated log collector service account to assume an IAM role in your AWS environment using a short-lived OIDC token, without storing any long-lived credentials. This is the Workload Federated Identity option in the Amazon S3 collection configuration and is the recommended option when available.
  * Designate an AWS IAM user, where you will need to know the Account ID for the user and have the relevant permissions to create an access key/id for the relevant IAM user. This is the default option when you configure the Amazon S3 collection by selecting Access Key.
  * Create an assumed role in AWS to delegate permissions to a Cortex XSIAM AWS service. This role grants Cortex XSIAM access to your flow logs. For more information, see [Creating a role to delegate permissions to an AWS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html). This is the Assumed Role option when you configure the Amazon S3 collection in Cortex XSIAM. For more information on creating an assumed role for Cortex XSIAM, see [create an assumed role](create-an-assumed-role). To collect Amazon S3 logs that use server-side encryption (SSE), the user role must have an IAM policy that states that Cortex XSIAM has kms:Decrypt permissions. With this permission, Amazon S3 automatically detects if a bucket is encrypted and decrypts it. If you want to collect encrypted logs from different accounts, you must have the decrypt permissions for the user role also in the key policy for the master account Key Management Service (KMS). For more information, see [Allowing users in other accounts to use a KMS key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policy-modifying-external-accounts.html).
* If using Workload Federated Identity, ensure you have permissions to create an AWS IAM Identity Provider and an IAM role with a trust policy in your AWS account. You will need the Cortex XSIAM service account identifier (provided in the Cortex XSIAM UI after saving the configuration) to configure the trust relationship.

Configure Cortex XSIAM to receive network Route 53 DNS logs from Amazon S3 using the CloudFormation Script.

1. Download the CloudFormation Script in Cortex XSIAM.
