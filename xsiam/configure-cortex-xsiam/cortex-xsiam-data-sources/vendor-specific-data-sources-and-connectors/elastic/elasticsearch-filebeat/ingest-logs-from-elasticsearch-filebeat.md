# Ingest logs from Elasticsearch Filebeat

If you want to ingest logs about file activity on your endpoints and servers and do not use the Cortex XDR agent, you can install Elasticsearch Filebeat as a system logger and then forward those logs to Cortex XSIAM. To facilitate log ingestion, Cortex XSIAM supports the same protocols that Filebeat and Elasticsearch use to communicate. Cortex XSIAM supports using Filebeat up to version 8.2 with the Filebeat data collector. Cortex XSIAM also supports logs in single line format or multiline format. For more information on handling messages that span multiple lines of text in Elasticsearch Filebeat, see [Manage Multiline Messages](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/multiline-examples.html).

Cortex XSIAM supports all sections in the `filebeat.yml` configuration file, such as support for Filebeat fields and tags. As a result, this enables you to use the [add\_fields](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/add-fields.html) processor to identify the product/vendor for the data collected by Filebeat so the collected events go through the ingestion flow (Parsing Rules). To configure the product/vendor ensure that you use the default `fields` attribute, as opposed to the `target` attribute, as shown in the following example.

```
processors:
  - add_fields:
      fields:
        vendor: <Vendor>
        product: <Product>
```

To provide additional context during investigations, Cortex XSIAM automatically creates a new Cortex Query Language (XQL) dataset from your Filebeat logs. You can then use the XQL dataset to search across the logs Cortex XSIAM received from Filebeat.

To receive logs, you configure collection settings for Filebeat in Cortex XSIAM and output settings in your Filebeat installations. As soon as Cortex XSIAM begins receiving logs, the data is visible in XQL Search queries.

1.  In Cortex XSIAM, set up Data Collection.

    a. Navigate to **Settings → Data Sources & Integrations**.

    b. On the **Data Sources & Integrations** page, click **+ Add New**, search for **Custom - Filebeat**, then hover over it and click **Add**.

    c. Specify a descriptive **Name** for your Filebeat log collection configuration.

    d. Specify the **Vendor** and **Product** for the type of logs you are ingesting.

    The vendor and product are used to define the name of your XQL dataset (`<vendor>_<product>_raw`). If you do not define a vendor or product, Cortex XSIAM examines the log header to identify the type and uses that to define the vendor and product in the dataset. For example, if the type is Acme and you opt to let Cortex XSIAM determine the values, the dataset name would be `acme_acme_raw`.

    e. **Save & Generate Token.**

    Click the copy icon next to the key and record it somewhere safe. You will need to provide this key when you set up output settings on your Filebeat instance. If you forget to record the key and close the window you will need to generate a new key and repeat this process.
2.  **Set up Filebeat to forward logs.**

    After installing the Filebeat agent, configure an Elasticsearch output:

    a. Under the **output.elasticsearch** section, configure the following entities:

    * **`hosts`:** Copy the API URL from your Filebeat configuration and paste it in this field.
    * **`compression_level`:** 5 (recommended)
    * **`bulk_max_size`:** 1000 (recommended)
    * **`api_key`:** Paste the key you created in when you configured Filebeat Log Collection in Cortex XSIAM.
    * **`proxy_url`:** (Optional) `<server_ip>:<port_number>`. You can specify your own `<server_ip>` or use the Broker VM to proxy Filebeat communication using the format `<Broker_VM_ip>:<port_number>`. When using the Broker VM, ensure that you activate the Local Agent Settings applet with the Agent Proxy enabled.

    b. Save the changes to your output file.

After Cortex XSIAM begins receiving logs from Filebeat, they will be available in XQL Search queries.

3.  (Optional) Monitor your Filebeat integration.

    You can return to the **Settings → Configurations → Data Collection → Custom Collectors** page to monitor the status of your Filebeat configuration. For each instance, Cortex XSIAM displays the number of logs received in the last hour, day, and week. You can also use the Data Ingestion Dashboard to view general statistics about your data ingestion configurations.
4. (Optional) Set up issue notifications to monitor the following events.
   * A Filebeat agent status changes to disconnected.
   * A Filebeat module has stopped sending logs.
