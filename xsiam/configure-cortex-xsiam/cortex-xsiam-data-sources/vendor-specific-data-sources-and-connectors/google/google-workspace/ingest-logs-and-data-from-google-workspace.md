# Ingest logs and data from Google Workspace

Cortex XSIAM can ingest various types of data from Google Workspace. Most data is collected as audit events from various Google reports using the Google Workspace data collector.

To receive logs from Google Workspace for any of the data types except emails, you must first enable the Google Workspace Admin SDK API with a user with access to the Admin SDK Reports API. For emails, you must set up a compliance email account as explained in the prerequisite steps below and then enable the Google Workspace Gmail API.

Once implemented, you can then configure the Data Sources & Integrations settings in Cortex XSIAM. After you set up data collection, Cortex XSIAM begins receiving new logs and data from the source.

### Ingestible data types

Cortex XSIAM can ingest the following data types:

* Google Chrome: Chrome browser and Chrome OS events from activity reports.
* Admin Console: Administrator activity events from audit logs.
* Google Chat: Activity events from Chat reports.
* Enterprise Groups: Group activity events from Enterprise Groups reports.
* Login: Information regarding login activity events.
* Rules: Activity events included in Rules activity reports.
* Google drive: Activity events from Google Drive application reports.
* Token: Token activity events from Token application reports.
* User Accounts: Activity events related to user accounts.
* SAML: Activity events included in SAML activity reports.
* Alerts: Alerts retrieved via the Alert Center API.
* Emails: Message details, excluding headers and body content (`payload.body`, `payload.parts`, and `snippet`), via a compliance mailbox to ingest email data (not email reports).

### Required Google APIs

The following Google APIs must be enabled in your Google Cloud project:

* **For all data types except emails**: [Admin SDK API](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk).
* **For all data types except alerts and emails**: [Admin Reports API](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/reference/rest) (part of Admin SDK API). ### Note For all types of data collected via the Admin Reports API, except alerts and emails, the log events are collected with a preset lag time as reported by Google Workspace. For more information on these lag times for the different types of data, see [Google Workspace Data retention and lag times](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7061566?hl=en).
* **Alerts**: [Alert Center API](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/alertcenter) (part of Admin SDK API).
* **Emails**: [Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api).

### Prerequisite Steps

* **For all data types except emails**: Complete the Google Workspace Reports API Prerequisites to set up the Google Workspace Admin SDK environment. This entails completing the instructions for **Set up the basics** and **Set up a Google API Console project** _without_ activating the Reports API service as this will be explained in greater detail in the task below. For more information on these Google Workspace prerequisite steps, see [Reports API Prerequisites](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/guides/prerequisites).
* **For Alerts only**: If you are not configuring other data types, you must still set up a [Cloud Platform project](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/alertcenter/quickstart/java) and enable the Alert Center API.
*   **For Google Emails**:

    1. Set up a compliance email account (compliance mailbox) to receive email data.
    2.  Set up a BCC for all incoming and outgoing emails of any user to this compliance account.

        a. Login to the [Admin direct routing URL](https://admin.google.com/ac/apps/gmail/routing) in Google Workspace for the user account that you want to configure.

        b. Double-click Routing, and set the following parameters in the Add setting dialog. \\

        * Routing: Configure the compliance email account that you want to receive a BCC for emails from this user account using the format `BCC TO <compliance email>`. For example, `BCC TO admin@organization.com`.
        * Select Inbound and Outbound to ensure all incoming and outgoing emails are sent.
        * (Optional) To configure another email address to receive a BCC for emails from this account, select Add more recipients in the Also deliver to section, and then click Add.
        * Click Show options, and from the list displayed select Account types to affect → Users.
        * Save your changes.\
          This configuration ensures to forward every message sent to a user account to a defined compliance mailbox. After the Google Workspace data collector ingests the emails, they are deleted from the compliance mailbox to prevent email from building up over time (nothing touches the actual users’ mailboxes). \\

    <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="info" class="hint hint-info"><p><strong>Note</strong></p><ul><li>Spam emails from the compliance email account, and from all other monitored email accounts, are not collected.</li><li>Any draft emails written in the compliance email account are collected by the Google Workspace data collector, and are then deleted even if the email was never sent.</li></ul></div>
* **Create a custom role with at least these permissions**: To follow the principle of least privilege, you must create a custom role in the Google Admin Console to ensure the user being impersonated has at least the following permissions:
  1. In the Google Admin Console, select Account → Admin roles.
  2. Click Create new role.
  3. Assign at least the following permissions:
  * Reports: View Reports.
  * Services: Alerts (Full Access).
  4. Assign this custom role to the user account you intend to use for impersonation. Record this user's email address.

### Set up the Google Workspace integration

#### Task 1. Perform Google Workspace Domain-Wide Delegation of Authority

When collecting any type of data from Google Workspace, except Google emails, you must authorize your service account to access user data on your Google Workspace domain without requiring each user to manually give consent.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

For more information on the entire process, see [Perform Google Workspace Domain-Wide Delegation of Authority](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/guides/delegation).
{% endhint %}

1.  In your [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project](https://console.cloud.google.com/), enable the Admin SDK API to create a service account and set credentials for this service account.

    As you complete this step, you need to gather information related to your service account, including the Client ID, Private key file, and Email address, which you will need to use later on in this task.

    a. Select the menu icon → **APIs & Services** → **Library**.

    b. Search for the **`Admin SDK API`**, and select the API from the results list.

    c. **Enable** the Admin SDK API.

    d. Select **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**.

    e. Select **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS** → **Service account**.

    f. Set the following **Service account** details in the applicable fields:

    * Specify a service account name. This name is automatically used to populate the following field as the service account ID, where the name is changed to lowercase letters and all spaces are changed to hyphens.
    * Specify the service account ID, where you can either leave the default service account ID or add a new one. This service account ID is used to set the service account email using the following format: `<id>@<project name>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
    * (Optional) Specify a service account description.

    g. **CREATE AND CONTINUE**.

    h. (Optional) Decide whether you want to **Grant this service account access to project** or **Grant users access to this service account**.

    i. Click **Done**.

    j. Select your newly created **Service Account** from the list.

    k. Create a service account private key and download the private key file as a JSON file.

    \
    In the **Keys** tab, select **ADD KEY** → **Create new key**, leave the default **Key type** set to **JSON**, and **CREATE** the private key. Once you’ve downloaded the new private key pair to your machine, ensure that you store it in a secure location, because it’s the only copy of this key. You will need to browse to this JSON file when configuring the Google Workplace data collector in Cortex XSIAM.

    <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="info" class="hint hint-info"><p><strong>Note</strong></p><p>You don't need to add permissions to the GCP Project-org service account.</p></div>
2.  When collecting alerts, enable the Alert Center API to create a service account and set credentials for this service account.

    <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="info" class="hint hint-info"><p><strong>Note</strong></p><p>When collecting Google Workspace alerts with other types of data, except emails, you need to configure a service account in Google with the applicable permissions to collect events from the Google Reports API and alerts from the Alert Center API. If you prefer to use different service accounts to collect events and alerts separately, you'll need to create two service accounts with different instances of the Google Workspace data collector. One instance to collect events with a certain service account, and another instance to collect alerts using another service account. The instructions below explain how to set up one Google Workspace instance to collect both event and alerts.</p></div>

    a. Select the menu icon → APIs & Services → Library.

    b. Search for the **`Alert Center API`**, and select the API from the results list.

    c. Enable the Alert Center API.

    d. Select APIs & Services → Credentials.

    e. Select the same service account in the Service Accounts section that you created for the Admin SDK API above.
3.  Delegate domain-wide authority to your service account with the Admin Reports API and Alert Center API scopes.

    a. Open the [Google Admin Console](https://admin.google.com/).

    b. Select Security → Access and data control → API controls.

    c. Scroll down to the Domain wide delegation section, and select MANAGE DOMAIN WIDE DELEGATION.

    d. Click Add new.

    e. Set the following settings to define permissions for the Admin SDK API:

    * Client ID: Specify the service account’s Unique ID, which you can obtain from the [Service accounts page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) by clicking the email of the service account to view further details. When creating a single Google Workspace data collector instance to collect both events and alert data, provide the same service account ID as the Admin SDK API.
    * In the OAuth scopes (comma-delimited) field, paste in the first of the two Admin Reports API scopes: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.reports.audit.readonly`
    * In the following OAuth scopes (comma-delimited) field, paste in the second Admin Reports API scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.reports.usage.readonly`

    <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="info" class="hint hint-info"><p><strong>Note</strong></p><p>For more information on the Admin Reports API scopes, see <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes">OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs</a>.</p></div>

    * When collecting alerts, add the following Alert Center API scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/apps.alerts`

    f. Authorize the domain-wide authority to your service account.\
    \
    This ensures that your service account now has domain-wide access to the Google Admin SDK Reports API and Google Workspace Alert Center API, if configured, for all of the users of your domain.

#### Task 2. Enable the Gmail API to collect Google emails

When you are configuring the Google Workspace data collector to collect Google emails, the instruction differ depending on whether you are configuring the collection along with other types of data with the Admin SDK API already set up or you are configuring the collection to only include emails using only the Gmail API. The steps below explain both scenarios.

1. Select the menu icon → APIs & Services → Library.
2. Search for the `Gmail API`, and select the API from the results list.
3. Enable the Gmail API.
4. Select APIs & Services → Credentials.\
   \
   The instructions for setting up credentials differ depending on whether you are setting up the Gmail API together with the Admin SDK API as you are collecting other data types, or you are configuring collection for emails only with the Gmail API.
   * When you’ve already set up the Admin SDK API, verify that the same Service Account that you configured for the Admin SDK API is listed, and continue on to the next step.
   * When you’re only collecting Google emails without the Admin SDK API, complete these steps.
     1. Select + CREATE CREDENTIALS → Service account.
     2. Set the following Service account details in the applicable fields. -Specify a service account name. This name is automatically used to populate the following field as the service account ID, where the name is changed to lowercase letters and all spaces are changed to hyphens. -Specify the service account ID, where you can either leave the default service account ID or add a new one. This service account ID is used to set the service account email using the following format: `<id>@<project name>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`. -(Optional) Specify a service account description.
     3. CREATE AND CONTINUE.
     4. (Optional) Decide whether you want to Grant this service account access to project or Grant users access to this service account.
     5. Click Done.
     6. Select your newly created Service Account from the list.
     7. Create a service account private key and download the private key file as a JSON file. In the Keys tab, select ADD KEY → Create new key, leave the default Key type set to JSON, and CREATE the private key. Once you’ve downloaded the new private key pair to your machine, ensure that you store it in a secure location as it’s the only copy of this key. You will need to browse to this JSON file when configuring the Google Workplace data collector in Cortex XSIAM .
5. Delegate domain-wide authority to your service account with the Gmail API scopes.
6. Open the [Google Admin Console](https://admin.google.com/).
7. Select Security → Access and data control → API controls.
8. Scroll down to the Domain wide delegation section, and select MANAGE DOMAIN WIDE DELEGATION.\
   This step explains how the following Gmail API scopes are added:
   * `https://mail.google.com/`
   * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.action.compose`
   * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.message.action`
   * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.message.metadata`
   * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.message.readonly`
   * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.compose`
   * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.insert`
   * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels`
   * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.metadata`
   * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify`
   * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`
   * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send`
   * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.basic`
   * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.sharing`

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

For more information on the Gmail API scopes, see [OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes).
{% endhint %}

The instructions differ depending on whether you are setting up the Gmail API together with the Admin SDK API as you are collecting other data types, or you are configuring collection for emails only with the Gmail API.

* When you’ve already set up the Admin SDK API, Edit the same Service Account that you configured for the Admin SDK API, and add the Gmail API scopes listed above.
*   When you’re only collecting Google emails without the Admin SDK API, click Add New, and set the following settings to define permissions for the Admin SDK API.<br>

    Client ID—Specify the service account’s Unique ID, which you can obtain from the [Service accounts page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) by clicking the email of the service account to view further details.\
    \
    In the OAuth scopes (comma-delimited) field, paste in the first of the Gmail API scopes listed above, and continue adding in the rest of the scopes.\
    \
    Authorize the domain-wide authority to your service account. This ensures that your service account now has domain-wide access to the Google Gmail API for all of the users of your domain.

#### Task 3. Prepare your service account to impersonate a user with access to the Admin SDK Reports API

You can prepare your service account to impersonate a user with access to the Admin SDK Reports API when collecting any type of data from Google Workspace except Google emails.

Only users with access to the Admin APIs can access the Admin SDK Reports API. Therefore, your service account needs to be set up to impersonate one of these users to access the Admin SDK Reports API. This means that when collecting any type of data from Google Workspace except Google emails, you need to designate a user whose Roles permissions are set to access reports, where Security → Reports is selected. This user’s email will be required when configuring the Google Workspace data collector in Cortex XSIAM.

1. In the [Google Admin Console](https://admin.google.com/), select Directory → Users.
2. From the list of users listed, select the user configured with the necessary permissions in Admin roles and privileges to view reports that you want to set up your service account to impersonate. This is the user you created the custom role for in the Create a custom role with at least these permissions of the prerequisite steps above.
3. Record the email of this user as you will need it in Cortex XSIAM .

#### Task 4. Integrate with Cortex XSIAM

1. In Cortex XSIAM, select Settings → Data Sources & Integrations.
2. On the Data Sources & Integrations page, click + Add New, search for Google Workspace, then hover over it and click Add.
3.  Integrate the applicable Google Workspace service with Cortex XSIAM.

    a. Specify a descriptive **Name** for your log collection integration.

    b. **Browse** to the JSON file containing your service account key **Credentials** for the Google Workspace Admin SDK API that you enabled. If you’re only collecting Google emails, ensure that you **Browse** to the JSON file containing your service account private key **Credentials** for the Gmail API that you enabled.\
    c. Select the types of data that you want to **Collect** from Google Workspace.

    * **Google Chrome**: [Chrome browser and Chrome OS events](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/appendix/activity/chrome) included in the Chrome activity reports.
    * **Admin Console**: Account information about different types of [administrator activity events](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/appendix/activity/admin-event-names) included in the Admin console application's activity reports.
    * **Google Chat**: [Chat activity events](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/appendix/activity/chat) included in the Chat activity reports.
    * **Enterprise Groups**: [Enterprise group activity events](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/appendix/activity/groups-enterprise) included in the Enterprise Groups activity reports.
    * **Login**: Account information about different types of [login activity events](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/appendix/activity/login) included in the Login application's activity reports.
    * **Rules**: [Rules activity events](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/appendix/activity/rules) included in the Rules activity report.
    * **Google drive**: [Google Drive activity events](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/appendix/activity/drive) included in the Google Drive application's activity reports.
    * **Token**: [Token activity events](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/appendix/activity/token) included in the Token application's activity reports.
    * **User Accounts**: Account information about different types of [User Accounts activity events](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/appendix/activity/user-accounts) included in the User Accounts application's activity reports.
    * **SAML**: [SAML activity events](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/appendix/activity/saml) included in the SAML activity report.
    * **Alerts**: Alerts from the \[Alert Center API beta version]\(http:// https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/alertcenter/guides), which is still subject to change.
    * **Emails**: Collects email data (not emails reports). All message details except email headers and email content (`payload.body`, `payload.parts`, and `snippet`).

    <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="info" class="hint hint-info"><p><strong>Note</strong></p><p>For more information about the events collected from the various Google Reports, see <a href="https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/reference/rest/v1/activities/list#ApplicationName">Google Workspace Reports API Documentation</a>.</p></div>

    For all options selected, except Emails, you must specify the **Service Account Email**. This is the email account of the user with access to the Admin SDK Reports API that you prepared your service account to impersonate.

    When selecting **Emails**, configure the following.

    * **Audit Email Account**: Specify the email address for the compliance mailbox that you set up.

    d. **Test** the connection settings.

    To test the connection, you must select one or more log types. Cortex XSIAM then tests the connection settings for the selected log types.

    e. If successful, **Enable** Google Workspace log collection.

### Data visualization and analysis

When Cortex XSIAM begins receiving logs, the app creates a new dataset for the different types of data that you are collecting, which you can use to initiate XQL Search queries. For example queries, refer to the in-app XQL Library.

For all logs, Cortex XSIAM can generate Cortex XSIAM issues for Correlation Rules only, when relevant from Google Workspace logs.

For the different types of data you can collect using the Google Workspace data collector, the following table lists the different datasets, vendors, and products automatically configured, and whether the data is normalized.

| Data type         | Dataset                                  | Vendor | Product                     | Normalized data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
