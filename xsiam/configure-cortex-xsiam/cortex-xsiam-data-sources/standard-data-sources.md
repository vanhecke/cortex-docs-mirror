# Standard data sources

Standard data sources are built-in ingestion mechanisms in Cortex XSIAM primarily focused on ingesting raw logs and security events. While Cortex XSIAM is introducing a unified **Connector** approach, many third-party services and file-based ingestions continue to use standard data sources for core security analysis and normalization.

These data sources (also called data collectors) typically utilize direct API connections or file collection tools to bring telemetry into the platform.

### Configuration experience

Standard data sources are configured using the Data Source Onboarder. Unlike the multi-capability connector wizard, the onboarder is focused on a specific stream of data, such as Okta logs or Amazon S3 files.

#### Key Features

* **Direct ingestion**: Connect directly to vendor APIs to fetch logs.
* **Parsing and normalization**: Automatically maps incoming raw data to the Cortex Data Model (XDM).
* **Streamlined Setup**: Focused exclusively on data collection without additional components like automation or posture management.

### When to use standard data sources

In the current Vendor Catalog, you may see a choice between a connector and a standard data source for the same vendor.

* **Existing tenants**: If a unified connector is not yet available for a specific integration in your account, use the standard data source.
* **New tenants**: Always prioritize using the uniquely named connector for a vendor. Standard data sources should only be used if a connector does not yet exist for that specific vendor or if you only require a specific raw log stream not currently bundled in a connector.

### Configuration

Standard data sources are configured by navigating to **Settings → Data Sources & Integrations → + Add New**.

Select your desired vendor and look for the entry labeled as a data source or collector. The UI will launch the Data Source Onboarder to guide you through the setup steps.
