# How to onboard Google Cloud Platform

After completing the prerequisites, follow these instructions to onboard your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment to Cortex XSIAM.

## Access the GCP onboarding wizard in Cortex XSIAM:

1. In Cortex XSIAM, select Settings → Data Sources & Integrations.
2. On the Data Sources & Integrations page, click + Add New.
3. On the Add Data Sources or Integrations page, search for Google Cloud Platform (GCP), then hover over it and click Add.

## Select the GCP environment

* In the GCP onboarding wizard, select the type of GCP environment:
  * **Government:** GCP GovCloud environments for compatibility with FedRAMP-certified tenants.
  * **Commercial:** (Default) Standard cloud deployment typically used for private and public sector organizations that do not require isolated government-specific infrastructure.

## Select the scope

* Select the scope for this cloud instance:
  * **Organization:** (Default) A collection of GCP projects that are managed centrally.
  * **Folder:** A GCP folder can contain projects, folders, or a combination of both projects and folders.
  * **Project:** A specific GCP project.

## Choose the scan mode

* Specify the scanning infrastructure for your cloud instance by selecting one of the following scan modes:
  * **Cloud Scan:** (Recommended) Security scanning is performed in the Cortex XSIAM cloud environment.
  *   **Scan with Outpost:** Security scanning is performed on infrastructure deployed to a cloud account owned by you. If you select this option, choose the outpost account to use for this instance.

## Configure advanced settings (optional)

*   Click Show advanced settings to define the following advanced settings:

    * **Instance Name:** Enter a unique instance name or leave it empty to be automatically populated. The automatic naming convention is ``GCP- or `GCP-`<organizationID>``. Cortex XSIAM does not prevent you from reusing instance names, but it is best practice to use a unique name for every cloud instance.
    * **Scope Modifications:** Use these settings to fine-tune your GCP scope. You can modify the scope by including or excluding specific regions. Additionally, if you selected an organization or folder as the scope, you can modify the scope by including or excluding specific folders or projects. For more details, see [Apply region or account filters](..).
    * **Additional Security Capabilities:** Choose which security capabilities you want to benefit from. Some security capabilities are enabled by default and can be modified. Adding security capability typically requires additional cloud provider permissions. For detailed information on the permissions required, see [Cloud service provider permissions](../cloud-service-provider-permissions).
      * **Data security posture management:** An agentless data security scanner that discovers, classifies, protects, and governs sensitive data.
      * **Registry scanning:** A container registry scanner that scans registry images for vulnerabilities, malware, and secrets. For more details, see [Configure registry scanning for cloud accounts](../../cloud-posture-and-runtime-security-data-sources/container-registry-scanning/configure-registry-scanning-for-cloud-accounts).
      * **Serverless functions scanning:** Implement serverless scanning to detect and remediate vulnerabilities within serverless functions during the development lifecycle. Seamless integration into CI/CD pipelines enables automated security scans for a continuously secure pre-production environment.
      * **Automation:** Use automation to pre-configure a list of integrations and associated commands to automate security issue responses. Commands can be utilized individually or as part of custom playbooks for issue remediation.
        * **Log Level:** (Optional - for Automation only) Configure the automation integration logging level. Possible values are:
          * Off (Default)
          * Debug
          * Verbose
      * **Agentless disk scanning:** (Recommended) Implement agentless disk scanning to remotely detect and remediate vulnerabilities during the development lifecycle.
    * **Cloud Tags:** Define tags and tag values to be added to any new resource created by Cortex XSIAM in GCP. Note: The `managed_by = paloaltonetworks` tag is automatically added to all resources. This tag is mandatory. You cannot edit or remove this tag.
    * **Log Collection Configuration:** To maximize security coverage, include the collection of audit logs (GCP Pub/Sub). This may require additional cloud service provider permissions. For detailed information on the permissions required, see [Cloud service provider permissions](../cloud-service-provider-permissions).
    *   Connect to GCP Workspace: Gain a comprehensive view of your Google Workspace identities and security. This provides you with detailed information on your users, groups, and organizational units, and collects security event logs to help you detect threats, improve your security posture, and meet compliance requirements.

        <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="info" class="hint hint-info"><h4>Note</h4><p>If you want to connect to your GCP Workspace, you must first complete onboarding with the option disabled. Once the GCP cloud instance is created, perform the steps detailed in <a href="connect-google-workspace-with-your-gcp-cloud-instance">Connect Google Workspace with your GCP cloud instance</a>.</p></div>
    * **Upload unknown files to WildFire:** Use this option to upload unknown files scanned during registry image scans to WildFire for detonation analysis. This option expands malware detection by allowing WildFire to analyze new samples found in your registry images. When a detonation result returns a malicious verdict, the system re-evaluates the relevant registry image and creates a malware finding.

## Save the configuration and download the template

1. Click Save. Cortex XSIAM generates a Terraform authentication template based on the settings you configured in the GCP onboarding wizard. Cortex XSIAM creates an instance in the pending state. For details on pending instances, see [Pending cloud instances](../pending-cloud-instances).
2.  Click Download Terraform to download the template file and then click Close.

    The Terraform authentication template is reusable and can be applied as many times as you want to create new instances with the settings you defined in the GCP onboarding wizard. The Terraform authentication template is valid for seven days from when it was created.

**Next step:** Deploy the Terraform authentication template in GCP.
