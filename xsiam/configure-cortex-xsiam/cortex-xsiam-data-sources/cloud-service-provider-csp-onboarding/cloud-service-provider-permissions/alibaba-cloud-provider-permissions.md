# Alibaba Cloud provider permissions

When onboarding Alibaba Cloud, Cortex XSIAM requests only the permissions needed for the security capabilities you enable, following the principle of least privilege. Alibaba Cloud onboarding is performed at the account scope using a single Terraform connector template that provisions a RAM role, a custom RAM policy, a role-policy attachment, and trusts an existing OIDC Identity Provider for Workload Identity Federation (WIF).

Permissions fall into the following categories:

* **Required for all onboarding**:\
  Base and Discovery Engine permission (IAM) capabilities. These provide the asset visibility and identity analysis that all Cortex XSIAM features depend on, and cannot be deselected.
* **Conditional upon selected capabilities**: _Currently not applicable_.\
  Additional Alibaba Cloud capabilities (Agentless Disk Scanning, Data Security Posture Management, Audit Logs, Registry Scanning, Serverless Scanning, and Automation) are not currently supported for Alibaba Cloud. Permissions for those capabilities will be added in a future release.

The following reference tables are organized by capability, role, and then the list of the CSP permissions being requested as well as their purpose:

* [Base (Including Discovery Engine)](#base-including-discovery-engine)

## Base (Including Discovery Engine)

Base and Discovery Engine permissions represent the foundational, mandatory role and policy assignments required to successfully onboard your Alibaba Cloud account to Cortex XSIAM. They provide read-only inventory of Alibaba Cloud resources (Discovery) and read-only analysis of RAM identities and policies (Base).

> **Important:** The Base and Discovery Engine capabilities are mandatory. Cortex XSIAM deploys them automatically when you onboard an Alibaba Cloud account. This onboarding includes no other capabilities.

### Base Cortex XSIAM platform role: `CortexPlatformRole-{suffix}`

This custom Alibaba Cloud RAM role contains the read-only permissions needed for Cortex XSIAM to inventory Alibaba Cloud resources and analyze RAM users, roles, groups, and policies. The role is assumed by Cortex XSIAM through Workload Identity Federation (WIF) with the customer’s existing OIDC Identity Provider. The attached policy grants no create, modify, or delete permissions on customer resources.

**`CortexPlatformReadOnlyPolicy-{suffix}` permissions**

## Capabilities not currently supported

The following Cortex XSIAM capabilities are not currently supported for Alibaba Cloud onboarding. No permissions for these capabilities are requested:

* Agentless Disk Scanning (ADS)
* Data Security Posture Management (DSPM)
* Audit Logs (log collection)
* Registry Scanning
* Serverless Scanning
