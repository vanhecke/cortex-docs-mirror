# Post-deployment: Custom (BYOB) and Control Tower audit log collection

If you selected **Custom (BYOB)** or **Custom Control Tower** audit log collection, link your existing CloudTrail notification pipeline to the SQS queue created by the template. The SQS queue receives messages by subscribing to the SNS topic, which acts as the intermediary. You can route these notifications using either of the following methods:

* **CloudTrail → SNS**: (Recommended) If your CloudTrail trail is already configured to publish delivery notifications to an SNS topic, the Cortex-created SQS queue subscribes to that topic automatically via the SNS subscription resource in the template. No additional S3 configuration is needed.
* **S3 → SNS**: If your S3 bucket is not yet connected to an SNS topic, configure an S3 event notification on the bucket to send `s3:ObjectCreated:*` events to the SNS topic named in the `CloudTrailSnsArn` parameter. The SNS topic then fans out to the SQS queue.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="CloudFormation Custom (BYOB)" %}
The CloudFormation stack creates the SQS queue in your account. You must manually configure your S3 bucket to send event notifications to it.

1. In the AWS CloudFormation console, open the stack and select the **Outputs** tab.
2. Note the `sqs_url` output value.
3. Derive the SQS queue ARN from the URL (format: `arn:aws:sqs:<region>:<account-id>:<queue-name>`), or retrieve it from the AWS SQS console.
4. Confirm which notification route applies to your setup:
   * If your CloudTrail trail already publishes to the SNS topic you provided as `CloudTrailSnsArn`: No additional configuration is needed. The template's SNS subscription connects the topic to the SQS queue automatically.
   * If your S3 bucket does not yet send notifications to the SNS topic: In the AWS Management Console, navigate to your S3 bucket. Under **Properties → Event notifications**, add a notification with event type `s3:ObjectCreated:*` and destination set to the SNS topic ARN you provided as `CloudTrailSnsArn`. Save the notification configuration.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="CloudFormation Control Tower" %}
The Control Tower BYOB CloudFormation stack deploys the SQS queue and SNS subscription automatically via CloudFormation StackSets into the account where your SNS topic resides. No manual S3 event notification configuration is required. The SNS-to-SQS subscription is created by the StackSet.

After the stack completes, you can verify the following in the AWS Management Console:

1. In the SNS topic account, confirm that the SQS queue named `<SqsQueueName>` (the value you entered in the wizard) exists and has an active subscription to your CloudTrail SNS topic.
2. In the logging account, confirm that the IAM role named `<CloudTrailReadRoleName>` (the value you entered in the wizard) exists and has the correct trust policy and S3 read permissions.
3. In Cortex XSIAM, verify that the cloud instance transitions from **Pending** to **Connected**.

#### Important

If you are using Control Tower for audit log collection and you choose to encrypt your logs with a KMS key, you must [grant cross-account KMS key access](grant-cross-account-kms-key-access-for-control-tower-byob-log-collection).
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Terraform (account scope)" %}
The Terraform template creates the SQS queue in your account. You must manually configure your S3 bucket to send event notifications to it.

1. In the `terraform apply` output, note the `sqs_url` value.
2. Derive the SQS queue ARN from the URL (format: `arn:aws:sqs:<region>:<account-id>:<queue-name>`), or retrieve it from the AWS SQS console.
3. Confirm which notification route applies to your setup:
   * If your CloudTrail trail already publishes to the SNS topic you provided as `cloud_trail_sns_arn`: No additional configuration is needed.
   * If your S3 bucket does not yet send notifications to the SNS topic: In the AWS Management Console, navigate to your S3 bucket. Under **Properties → Event notifications**, add a notification with event type `s3:ObjectCreated:*` and destination set to the SNS topic ARN you provided as `cloud_trail_sns_arn`. Save the notification configuration.

### Troubleshooting custom audit log collection

Use this section to diagnose issues with custom (BYOB) audit log collection after deploying the authentication template. The most common causes of failure are:

* **S3 event notifications not configured or misconfigured**: For Terraform and standard CloudFormation deployments, you must ensure your CloudTrail trail publishes delivery notifications to the SNS topic you provided, or configure your S3 bucket to send `s3:ObjectCreated:*` events to that SNS topic. The SNS topic fans out to the SQS queue created by the template. If neither route is configured, or the wrong SNS topic ARN is used, logs will not reach Cortex XSIAM.
* **Cross-region resources**: The S3 bucket, SNS topic, SQS queue, and authentication template deployment must all be in the same AWS region. Cross-region configurations are not supported.
* **KMS key policy not updated:** (Only relevant for Custom Control Tower audit log collection) If your S3 bucket is encrypted with a customer-managed KMS key, you must manually update the KMS key policy to allow the Cortex log-collector IAM role to call `kms:Decrypt`. This cannot be done automatically by the template.
* **Instance remains in Pending state**: This indicates the template deployed successfully but the notification to Cortex XSIAM did not complete. You can connect the instance manually from the Cortex XSIAM pending instances panel. See [Manually connect a cloud instance](../manually-connect-a-cloud-instance) for more details.
