# Alibaba Cloud security model and authentication

Cortex XSIAM implements a defense-in-depth security model built on the principle of least privilege. Every permission granted to Cortex XSIAM is read-only and has a clear purpose. This section describes the security principles, authentication mechanisms, and operational safeguards that protect your Alibaba Cloud environment.

### **Security principles**

* **No static credentials:** Cortex XSIAM never stores or exchanges static access keys. Authentication relies entirely on OIDC-based Workload Identity Federation with short-lived temporary credentials.
* **Minimal permissions by default:** Cortex XSIAM operates with the minimum read-only permissions scoped to specific Alibaba Cloud services. No write permissions are provisioned. The permission set cannot be expanded through the onboarding process.
* **Permission transparency:** Every permissions is mapped to a specific Alibaba Cloud API action. The complete permission set is visible in the Terraform authentication template before deployment, allowing security review prior to granting access.
* **Cloud-native identity and trust:** Authentication uses Alibaba Cloud's native OIDC provider and STS service. All permissions and resources are provisioned through a customer-reviewed Terraform template to ensure transparency.

### **Authentication mechanisms**

Cortex XSIAM uses a single OIDC-based identity flow for all operations (discovery and permissions analysis). Alibaba Cloud onboarding uses one identity for all access. The authentication flow works as follows:

1. The Cortex Service Account in the Cortex-managed GCP project obtains a GCP ID token with the audience `alibaba-cortex-wif-<tenantID>`.
2. The token is presented to the OIDC Identity Provider in the customer's Alibaba Cloud account.
3. The OIDC provider validates the token and Cortex XSIAM calls Alibaba Cloud STS `AssumeRoleWithOIDC` at `sts.<region>.aliyuncs.com`.
4. STS issues temporary credentials with a session name of `Cortex-WIF-Session` and a maximum session duration of 55 minutes (3300 seconds).
5. Cortex XSIAM uses the temporary credentials to assume the CortexPlatformRole and perform read-only discovery and permissions analysis.

### **Security considerations**

Cortex XSIAM incorporates the following security considerations to protect your Alibaba Cloud environment:

* **No persistent credentials:** OIDC tokens have a maximum expiry of 1 hour (3600 seconds) and STS sessions expire after 55 minutes (3300 seconds). Credentials are never stored. Instead, they are obtained on demand and discarded after use.
* **Single identity, minimal blast radius:** A single RAM role with read-only permissions limits the blast radius. Compromising the role grants no write access to any Alibaba Cloud resource.
* **Auditability:** All Cortex XSIAM operations are logged in Alibaba Cloud ActionTrail under the session name Cortex-WIF-Session. SOC teams can monitor and audit all Cortex access patterns independently.
* **Operational control:** The CortexPlatformRole can be disabled or deleted at any time in the Alibaba Cloud console to immediately revoke Cortex XSIAM access.
