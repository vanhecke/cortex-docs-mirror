# How to onboard Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

{% hint style="info" %}
#### License type

This feature is included with a Cortex XSIAM Premium license. It is also included with any other Cortex XSIAM license that has the Cloud Runtime Security or Cloud Posture Security add-ons.

For Cortex XSIAM NG SIEM, Cortex XSIAM Enterprise, and Cortex XSIAM Enterprise+ licenses, see [How to onboard Oracle Cloud Infrastructure with foundational configuration](how-to-onboard-oracle-cloud-infrastructure-with-foundational-configuration) .
{% endhint %}

After completing the prerequisites, follow these instructions to onboard your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) environment to Cortex XSIAM.

### Access the OCI onboarding wizard in Cortex XSIAM:

1. In Cortex XSIAM, select **Settings → Data Sources & Integrations**.
2. On the **Data Sources & Integrations** page, click **+ Add New**.
3. On the **Add Data Sources or Integrations** page, search for **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure**, then hover over it and click **Add**.

### Set the instance name (optional)

*   In **Instance Name**, enter a unique instance name.

    If you don't enter a name, Cortex XSIAM applies the default name, `OCI-<TENANCY_OCID>`. Cortex XSIAM does not prevent you from reusing instance names, but it is best practice to use a unique name for every cloud instance.

### Configure advanced settings (optional)

* Click **Show advanced settings** to define the following advanced settings:
  *   **Scope Modifications:** You can modify the scope by including or excluding specific Compartments. If you choose to include specific compartments, only the specified compartments and their sub-compartments will be included. This setting will affect future sub-compartments added to your OCI environment after onboarding. If you choose to exclude specific compartments, this setting will also affect their sub-compartments.

      **Note**: The root compartment is always onboarded, and only the sub-compartment scope can be modified.

      Excluded compartments are not visible in Cortex XSIAM.
  * **Additional Security Capabilities:** Choose which security capabilities you want to benefit from. Some security capabilities are enabled by default and can be modified. Adding security capability typically requires additional cloud provider permissions. For detailed information on the permissions required, see [Cloud service provider permissions](../cloud-service-provider-permissions).
    * **Data security posture management:** An agentless data security scanner that discovers, classifies, protects, and governs sensitive data.
    * **Registry scanning:** A container registry scanner that scans registry images for vulnerabilities, malware, and secrets. For more details, see [Configure registry scanning for cloud accounts](../../cloud-posture-and-runtime-security-data-sources/container-registry-scanning/configure-registry-scanning-for-cloud-accounts).
    * **Serverless functions scanning:** Implement serverless scanning to detect and remediate vulnerabilities within serverless functions during the development lifecycle. Seamless integration into CI/CD pipelines enables automated security scans for a continuously secure pre-production environment.
    * **Agentless disk scanning:** (Recommended) Implement agentless disk scanning to remotely detect and remediate vulnerabilities during the development lifecycle.
  * **Cloud Tags:** Define tags and tag values to be added to any new resource created by Cortex XSIAM in OCI. Note: The `managed_by = paloaltonetworks` tag is automatically added to all resources. This tag is mandatory. You cannot edit or remove this tag.
  * **Log Collection Configuration:** To maximize security coverage, enable the collection of audit logs. This may require additional cloud service provider permissions. For detailed information on the permissions required, see [Cloud service provider permissions](../cloud-service-provider-permissions). Enter the following details for each preexisting OCI storage bucket that you intend to use for log collection:
    * Region: The geographic OCI region where the bucket is located. For example, "us-phoenix-1".
    * Bucket Name: The name of the OCI storage bucket.
    * Compartment OCID: The Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID) of the compartment that contains the bucket.

### Save the configuration and download the authentication template

1. Click **Save**. Cortex XSIAM generates a Terraform authentication template based on the settings you configured in the OCI onboarding wizard. Cortex XSIAM creates an instance in the pending state. For details on pending instances, see [pending-cloud-instances](../pending-cloud-instances "mention").
2.  Download the OCI authentication template by clicking **Download Terraform**.

    The Terraform authentication template is reusable and can be executed as many times as you want to create new instances with the settings you defined in the wizard. The Terraform authentication template is valid for seven days from when it was created.
3. Click **Close**.

**Next step:** Deploy the Terraform authentication template in OCI.
