This topic explains the fundamentals for planning and deploying outpost infrastructure.

**Important**: While outposts provide maximum control over the scanning environment, cloud scan mode is the recommended default for most organizations.

## When to choose outpost scan

Cloud scan offers lower operational overhead, faster onboarding, and Palo Alto Networks assumes most of the associated cloud compute costs.

Outpost scan mode should typically only be reserved for specific architectural requirements or strict data residency constraints.

If you determine you do need outpost scanning, consider the following differences between the scan modes, which might impact your decision.

| Cloud Scan (Recommended)                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Outpost Scan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Configure a managed outpost when there is sufficient trust between you and Cortex XSIAM. Cortex accesses your environment more extensively and with less mediation.                                                                         | <p>Choose to deploy and manage your own outpost:<br></p><ul><li>If you operate in a high-regulated market with a healthy “mistrust” of vendors.</li><li>For compliance with certain regulations for which Cortex XSIAM is not compliant “out of the box.”</li></ul><p>In these cases, you might prefer to keep your data within your own network boundary.</p> |
| Most of the cloud resources involved are charged to Palo Alto Networks instead of to you, so scan costs are reduced.                                                                                                                        | This mode requires additional cloud provider permissions and may incur additional cloud costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Cortex-managed outposts require zero management from you.                                                                                                                                                                                   | Outposts incur some additional maintenance overhead. This includes securing the outpost, managing the necessary IAM roles and permissions, upgrading versions, and adjusting cloud provider quotas to meet workload demands. Actively manage your capacity and quotas to meet the workload requirements.                                                       |

## Outpost security concepts and component handling

This section presents outpost-related concepts and a high-level overview of how outposts perform scanning on your resources and data without putting them at risk. For a deeper understanding, contact your Palo Alto Networks representative.

| Concept                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trust model                                             | Cortex XSIAM interacts with your environment via dedicated IAM roles within the outpost. This establishes a secure trust relationship that adheres to the principle of least privilege.                                                              |
| Data security and residency                             | Outposts utilize a regionally symmetric architecture, processing data locally within the same cloud region and provider where it resides. Only metadata is ever sent back to Cortex XSIAM.                                                           |
| Scan operations                                         | Scanning is performed by task-specific, ephemeral VMs built from hardened and continuously patched images. These instances are automatically terminated and all temporary resources are purged immediately after a scan completes.                   |
| Secure orchestration storage (such as buckets)          | Scanner VMs operate in isolated private subnets without direct internet or Cortex XSIAM access. They communicate exclusively through encrypted, cloud-native storage used for operational data and scan results, never raw customer data.            |
| Temporary processing storage (such as artifact buckets) | For specific scans where direct data sharing is restricted, data is temporarily placed in encrypted regional storage for analysis. Cortex XSIAM has no read permissions on this storage, and all data is deleted immediately after the job finishes. |
| Scanner isolation                                       | Each scanner VM is purpose-built with a strictly defined set of permissions and network access tailored to its specific job. This ensures complete compartmentalization between different scan types.                                                |
| Data encryption                                         | Security is enforced through universal encryption at rest and in transit. Advanced egress filtering locks down external traffic to verified destinations, and secrets are managed via your own cloud-native secret management service.               |

### Deployment criteria for a standard outpost

A basic, standard outpost is suitable for your organization if the following conditions apply to your environment:

* Your organization is comfortable running Cortex-generated Terraform in your CSP account.
* Default naming conventions, network topology, and resource configurations meet your governance requirements.
* You do not need to pre-create tenant-level identities, use your own VPC or VNet, or route egress through your own proxy.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Notes**:

* Azure Entra ID app registration is supported.
* For custom outpost configurations, contact your Palo Alto Network representative for available options.
{% endhint %}

## Outpost planning

Before creating outposts, we recommend you become familiar with how outposts work and then plan accordingly. For example, some points to consider include:

* A dedicated account is required for the outpost account. Make sure the dedicated account is free from other resources.
* Each cloud account (AWS account, Azure subscription, GCP project) can host only one outpost.
* An individual outpost instance is strictly bound to a single Cortex XSIAM tenant and cannot be used to scan resources belonging to a different tenant or organization.
* Using an outpost requires additional cloud provider permissions and may incur additional cloud costs.
* Familiarize yourself with the needed permissions and resources expected to be added to the outpost during creation.

For exact implementation details, contact your Palo Alto Networks representative.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Notes:**

* Before you create your outpost, verify that your internet connection is active. An active internet connection is necessary for the notification to be sent to Cortex XSIAM to create the new outpost.
* (Azure) Due to limitations in Terraform, the Azure subscription name cannot contain blanks. Take this into account while onboarding.
