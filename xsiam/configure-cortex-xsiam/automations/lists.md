# Lists

Create and edit lists for use in playbooks and scripts.

A list is a data container for storing data and is mainly used in [playbooks](playbooks) and [scripts](scripts) but can be accessed anywhere the context button appears (double-curly brackets). For example, in a playbook task, access the data in a list via the context button under **Lists**, or by using the path `${lists.<list_name>}`. Different types of data can be stored in a list, for example, text, string, numbers, Markdown, HTML, CSS, and JSON objects.

{% hint style="info" %}
### Note

The maximum size of a list is 209715 characters.
{% endhint %}

**Use cases**

The following are use cases for lists:

* **Defining HTML templates**: An HTML template can be defined as part of a communication task.
* **Configuring Automation Exclusion Policies**: Create lists of critical assets that should be excluded from automated remediation. For more information, see [Manage automation exclusion policies](automation-exclusion-center/manage-automation-exclusion-policies).
* **Organizing Network Security**: Use lists to keep track of internal networks and their corresponding IP addresses. Compare them to a set list to ensure only authorized connections are allowed through.
* **Store Data Objects**: For example, a list of URLs, which you can call as an input for scripts and playbooks.
* **Prioritizing Case Response**: Create lists to identify critical assets, such as important users or servers. This helps improve incident management by prioritizing the most important incidents.
