# Filter considerations, categories, and built-in filters

Use built-in Cortex XSIAM filters to define playbook automation conditions. Filters are grouped by category. Review the following considerations before defining a filter.

### Cortex XSIAM playbook filter considerations

* Filters try to cast the transformed value and arguments to the appropriate type. The task fails if casting fails. For example, “a” Equals {“some”: “object”} => Error
* If the filter's left-side value expects a single item but receives a list, the filter passes if at least one item meets the requirements. For example, \[“a”, “b”, “c”] Equals “b” => true.
* If the filter's left-side value expects a list but receives a single item, it converts it to a list with a single item. For example, “a” Contains “a” => True.
* Some custom filters are implemented as scripts with the `filter` tag. You can find examples in the playbook automation task description.
* Filters in conditional tasks do not iterate the items of the root. Instead, they fetch the left-side value and the right-side value and compare them.

### Filter categories and built-in filters

When adding a playbook filter, click the default **Equals (String)** field. A search window opens with the available built-in filter operators. They are grouped by category as follows:

General filters such as Contains, Doesn’t Contain, In, and Is empty.
