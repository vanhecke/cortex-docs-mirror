# Create a child tenant

Create Cortex XSIAM child tenants in Cortex Gateway after setting up the main account. Allocate licensed employee, storage, and add-on resources to each child tenant. The number of child tenants depends on your license.

* The main account is labeled in Cortex Gateway, but child tenants are not labeled.
* Cortex enables parent-child pairing between tenants located in different geographical regions. To enable this capability, contact your support team.
* To create a child tenant, ensure that you have Account Admin permissions.

In Cortex Gateway, you can view all the available tenants. If you want to create more child tenants than your license permits, contact Customer Support.

1. In the Cortex Gateway, hover over the main account you activated previously until the three-dot menu appears and click Add Child Tenant.
2.  Add the following details:
