# Set up a remote repository

Set up a Cortex XSIAM remote repository to manage, version, and synchronize content across development and production tenants. Use the built-in repository, a private Git-based repository, or an on-premise repository.

### Cortex XSIAM remote repository considerations

* When you activate a tenant and enable the content repository in Cortex Gateway, Cortex XSIAM uses the built-in repository by default. The built-in remote repository requires less configuration than a private remote repository. You cannot access it directly. Configure a private repository when you enable the remote repository in the tenant.
* When activating a development tenant for a remote repository in Cortex Gateway, all existing cluster tenants must be activated and enabled for push and pull.
* After you enable a remote repository in a production pull tenant, the first activated development tenant pushes content by default. Additional development tenants pull content from the remote repository by default.
* If the content repository option is disabled for the production or development tenant (under **Settings** → **Configurations** → **General** → **Remote Repository Settings**, toggle the Content repository slider to off), the tenant becomes standalone and does not push or pull content. If you disable the remote repository feature, content on the tenant is not deleted. If you enable the remote repository feature again and the remote repository contains content, you need to choose which content to keep, either the content on the tenant or the content on the remote repository. We recommend backing up any content that you want to keep before enabling again.
* When enabling a remote repository in a tenant:
  * If the relevant repository branch is empty, it inherits the content of the tenant.
  * If the relevant branch is not empty, you can select which content to keep, either the existing content on your tenant or the existing content on the specified repository. If you want to keep the content on the tenant, you need to first disable the remote repository in the other tenants in the cluster (making them standalone). If even one tenant has remote repository enabled, you can only keep the existing content on the specified repository.
* For a simple single-branch deployment, use the built-in repository. Use a private Git repository for multiple branches or access outside Cortex XSIAM, such as scanner integration. To use a private remote repository with one or more branches, enable it in each tenant. Then configure the required branch in each tenant.
* Activation may take some time. You should receive notification by email that the production or development tenant has completed the activation process.
* Once the activation completes, you can only change content repository settings within the tenant.

### Before you set up a remote repository

* If you are changing your remote repository settings, back up existing content to your local computer by navigating to **Settings** → **Configurations** → **General** → **Server Settings** → **Custom Content** and click **Export all custom content**.
* You must have Instance Administrator or Account Admin permission to set up a Cortex XSIAM remote repository.
