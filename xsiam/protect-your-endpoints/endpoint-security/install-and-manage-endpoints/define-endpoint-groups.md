# Define endpoint groups

You can define an endpoint group and then apply policy rules and manage specific endpoints. If you set up Cloud Identity Engine, you can also leverage your Active Directory user, group, and computer details to define endpoint groups.

Do one of the following:

* Create a dynamic group by enabling Cortex XSIAM to populate your endpoint group dynamically using endpoint characteristics, such as an endpoint tag, partial hostname or alias, full or partial domain or workgroup name, IP address, range or subnets, installation type (VDI, temporary session or standard endpoint), agent version, endpoint type (workstation, server, mobile), user or operating system version.
* Create a static group by selecting a list of specific endpoints.

### Note

Configuration based on user granular policy is optimized for VDI and session-persistent environments; it is not recommended for decentralized or traditional endpoint architectures.

After you define an endpoint group, you can then use it to target policy and actions to specific recipients. The **Endpoint Groups** page displays all endpoint groups along with the number of endpoints and policy rules linked to the endpoint group.

#### How to define an endpoint group

1. Select **Inventory** → **Endpoints** → Groups → **+Add Group**.
2. Select one of the following:
   * **Create New** to create an endpoint group from scratch
   * **Upload From File** using plain text files with a new line separator, to populate a static endpoint group from a file containing IP addresses, hostnames, or aliases.
3. Enter a **Group Name** and optional description to identify the endpoint group. The name you assign to the group will be visible when you assign endpoint security profiles to endpoints.
4.  Determine the endpoint properties for creating an endpoint group:

    * **Dynamic:** Use the filters to define the criteria you want to use to dynamically populate an endpoint group. Dynamic groups support multiple criteria selections and can use **AND** or **OR** operators. For endpoint names and aliases, and domains and workgroups, you can use **`*`** to match any string of characters. As you apply filters, Cortex XSIAM displays any registered endpoint matches to help you validate your filter criteria.
    *   **Static:** Select specific registered endpoints that you want to include in the endpoint group. Use the filters, as needed, to reduce the number of results.

        When you create a static endpoint group from a file, the IP address, hostname, or alias of the endpoint must match an existing agent that has registered with Cortex XSIAM. You can select up to 250 endpoints.

5.  Create the endpoint group.

    After you save your endpoint group, it is ready for use to assign security profiles to endpoints and in other places where you can use endpoint groups.

At any time, you can return to the **Groups** page to view and manage your endpoint groups. To manage a group, right-click the group and select the desired action:

* **Edit:** View the endpoints that match the group definition, and optionally refine the membership criteria using filters.
* **Delete:** Remove the endpoint group.
* **Save as new:** Duplicate the endpoint group and save it as a new group.
* **Export group:** Export the list of endpoints that match the endpoint group criteria to a tab separated values (TSV) file.
* **View endpoints:** Pivot from an endpoint group to a filtered list of endpoints on the **All Endpoints** page where you can quickly view and initiate actions on the endpoints within the group.
