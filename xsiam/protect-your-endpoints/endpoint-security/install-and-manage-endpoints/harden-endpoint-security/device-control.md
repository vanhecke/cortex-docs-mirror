# Device control

By default, all external USB and Bluetooth devices are allowed to connect to your Windows and macOS-based Cortex XSIAM endpoints, and all print jobs are allowed. To protect endpoints from connecting to removable devices, such as disk drives, CD-ROM drives, floppy disk drives, Bluetooth devices, and other portable devices, that can contain malicious files, Cortex XSIAM provides device control. Different types of print jobs can also be blocked.

Using device control, you can:

* (Windows and macOS) Block all supported USB-connected devices for an endpoint group.
* (Windows and macOS) Block a USB device type but add to your allow list a specific vendor from that list that will be accessible from the endpoint.
* (Windows and macOS) Block connections to Classic Bluetooth devices or Low Energy Bluetooth services. These are two different Bluetooth protocols used for short-range wireless connections.
  * Some examples of Classic Bluetooth devices include: laptop computers, tablets, telephones, audio/video devices, wearables, peripherals, imaging devices, health devices, toys, and so on.
  * Some examples of Low Energy Bluetooth devices include: telephone alert status, microphone control, health sensors, insulin delivery, location and navigation, object transfer, and so on.
* Temporarily block only some device types on an endpoint.
  * USB devices (Windows and macOS)
  * Bluetooth devices (Windows and macOS)
* (Windows and macOS from agent 9.2 and later) Block or allow SD Cards connected on the PCI/PCIe bus.
* (Windows and macOS) Block some, or all, print jobs to local or network printers, or to file.
* Operating systems report on devices in different ways. Sometimes, the same BLE device will report different services and interfaces, depending on the host's operating system. This may have an effect on the specific BLE services that are blocked for each operating system.
* Depending on your defined user scope permissions, creating device profiles, policies, exceptions, and violations may be disabled.

The following are prerequisites to enforce device control policy rules on your endpoints:

**Device control profiles**

To apply device control in your organization, define device control profiles that determine which device types Cortex XSIAM blocks, and which it permits. There are two types of profiles:

5.  Select **Create** to save the profile.

    You can later edit, delete, or duplicate the profile.

    <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="info" class="hint hint-info"><p>You cannot edit or delete default Cortex XSIAM profiles.</p></div>
6. Optional: define exceptions in a Device Exceptions profile.
7. Apply the device control profiles to your endpoints.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Add a new device exceptions profile</summary>

1. In **Endpoints → Policy management → Extensions → Profiles**, select **+ New Profile** or **Import from File**.
2. Select a platform. Select **Device Exceptions → Next**.
3.  Complete the general information.

    Assign a profile name. You can add a description. The system sets the profile type and platform.
4.  Configure device exceptions.

    Add devices to the allow list with vendor, product, and serial number identifiers.

    * **Type**: Select Bluetooth, CD-ROM, Disk Drive, Floppy Disk, or Windows Portable Devices. Windows Portable Devices are Windows-only.
    * **Permission**: For disk drives, select **Read only** or **Read/Write**.
    * **Vendor**: Select a vendor or enter its hexadecimal vendor ID.
    * **Product**: Optionally select a vendor product or enter its hexadecimal product ID.
    * **Serial Number**: Optionally enter a product serial number. Quote serial numbers that end with a space. For example, `"K04M1972138 "`.
5.  Select **Create** to save the exceptions profile.

    You can later edit, delete, or duplicate the profile.

    <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="info" class="hint hint-info"><p>You cannot edit or delete predefined Cortex XSIAM profiles.</p></div>
6. Apply the device control profiles to your endpoints.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Apply device control profiles to your endpoints</summary>

After defining configuration and exceptions profiles, configure Device Control policies and enforce them on endpoints. Cortex XSIAM evaluates policies in page order. The first matching policy applies. If none match, the default policy enables all devices.

1.  In **Endpoints → Policy management → Extensions → Policy Rules**, select **+ New Policy** or **Import from File**.

    <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="info" class="hint hint-info"><p>When importing, choose whether to enable associated policy targets. New rules are added first. Default rules override the tenant default. Rules without targets remain disabled.</p></div>
2. Configure the Device Control policy.
   1. Assign a policy name and platform. You can add a description.
   2. Assign the Device Type profile for this rule.
   3. Select **Next**.
   4.  Select target endpoints.

       Use filters or manual endpoint selection. Group Name filtering respects your user scope.
   5. Select **Done**.
3.  Configure the policy hierarchy.

    Drag policies into execution order. The default policy always remains last. It applies when no other policy matches.
4.  Save the policy hierarchy.

    After the policy reaches agents, Cortex XSIAM enforces it.
5.  Optional: manage policy rules.

    In the **Protection Policy Rules** table, view and edit policies and their hierarchy.

    1. View the policy hierarchy.
    2. Right-click a policy to view details, edit, save as new, disable, or delete it.
    3. Select policies and choose **Export Policies**. You can include policy targets, global exceptions, and endpoint groups.
6.  Monitor device control violations.

    Use **Endpoints → Device Control Violations** to view blocked device and print job attempts. Sort results or filter the list.

    Violations can include:

    * ID, timestamp, endpoint host name, platform, agent ID, user name, and IP address.
    * Device type, GUID, vendor ID, vendor, product name, and serial number.
    * Print job type, document name, additional information, major class, minor class, and vendor type.

    Serial numbers are not supported for Bluetooth devices on Windows endpoints.

    Right-click a violation to add the device to permanent exceptions, temporary exceptions, or a profile exception.
7.  Tune device control exceptions.

    Allow-list entries require a device category, vendor, and permission. Optionally specify a product or serial number.

    * **Permanent exceptions** apply across all Device Control policies and profiles. They apply across platforms.
    * **Temporary exceptions** apply for up to 30 days.
    * **Profile exceptions** apply within an existing Device Exceptions profile.

    #### Create a permanent exception

    Permanent exceptions apply to all devices, regardless of endpoint platform.

    If you know the device in advance:

    1. Go to **Endpoints → Policy Management → Extensions → Device Permanent Exceptions**.
    2. Select the type, permission, and vendor.
    3. Optional: select a product or enter a serial number.
    4. Select the adjacent arrow and then **Save**.

    The exception applies at the next heartbeat.

    To create one from a violation:

    1. On **Device Control Violations**, right-click the relevant violation.
    2. Select **Add device to permanent exceptions**.

<summary>Add a custom device class</summary>

Windows only: add USB-connected device classes beyond Disk Drive, CD-ROM, Windows Portable Devices, and Floppy Disk Drives. For example, add USB-connected network adapters.

Supply the [official ClassGuid identifier](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/system-defined-device-setup-classes-available-to-vendors) from Microsoft. If a device has a configured GUID value, use that value.

After adding a class, view it in Device Management. You can enforce device control rules and exceptions for it.

1.  Go to **Endpoints → Policy Management → Settings → Device Management**.

    This page lists custom USB-connected devices.
2.  Select **+ New Device**.

    Set a name and a valid, unique GUID Identifier. Each GUID can define only one class type.
3. Select **Save**.

The new class is available with other Cortex XSIAM device classes.

<summary>Add a custom user notification</summary>

Personalize the Cortex XDR endpoint notification shown when users connect blocked USB devices. You can also customize notifications for read-only devices.

Configure notifications in the Agent Settings profile.

{% hint style="info" %}
Disabling Device Control Violation notifications requires Cortex XDR agent version 8.6 or later.

<summary>Ingest connect and disconnect events of USB devices</summary>

{% hint style="warning" %}
This feature requires a Cortex XSIAM Pro license.
{% endhint %}

XQL ingests USB connect and disconnect events reported by the agent. Set the endpoint profile's Device Configuration to **Block** to capture these events. Events are also captured for blocked device groups with permanent or temporary exceptions.

Use XQL Search with the `xdr_data` dataset to:

* Display devices by vendor ID, vendor name, product ID, and product name.
* Find hosts connected to a device by serial number.
* Find USB devices connected to specific hosts or host groups.

The following query returns `action_device_usb_product_name` for USB plug events:

```xql
dataset = xdr_data
| filter event_type = DEVICE and event_sub_type = DEVICE_PLUG
| fields action_device_usb_product_name
```

The following query returns `action_device_usb_vendor_name` from the `device_control` preset:

```xql
preset = device_control
| filter event_type = DEVICE
| fields action_device_usb_vendor_name
```
