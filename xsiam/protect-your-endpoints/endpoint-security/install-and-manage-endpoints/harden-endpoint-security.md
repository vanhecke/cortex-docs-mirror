# Harden endpoint security

You can extend the security on your endpoints beyond the Cortex XDR agent built-in prevention capabilities to provide increased network security coverage within your organization. By leveraging existing mechanisms and added capabilities, the Cortex XDR agent can enforce additional protections on your endpoints to provide a comprehensive security posture.

From **Inventory → Endpoints → Policy Management → Extensions → Profiles**, you can create profiles for the following hardened endpoint security capabilities.

The Extensions Profiles table lists the profile details per operating system. Profiles associated with one or more targets that are beyond your defined user scope are locked and cannot be edited.

| Field              | Description                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Associated Targets | Targets associated with the profile                                      |
| Created By         | Administrative user who created the profile                              |
| Created Time       | Date and time at which the profile was created                           |
| Description        | Optional description entered by an administrator to describe the profile |
| Modification Time  | Date and time at which the profile was modified                          |
| Modified By        | Administrative user who modified the profile                             |
| Name               | Name provided to identify the security profile                           |
| Platform           | Platform type of the profile                                             |
| Summary            | Summary of profile configuration                                         |
| Type               | Profile type                                                             |
| Usage Count        | Number of policy rules that use the profile                              |

***

To apply the profiles, from **Inventory → Endpoints → Policy Management → Extensions → Policy Rules**, you can view all the policy rules per operating system. Rules associated with one or more targets that are beyond your defined user scope are locked and cannot be edited.

The following table describes for each capability the supported platforms and minimal agent version. A dash (—) indicates the setting is not supported.

Hardened endpoint security capabilities are not supported for Android or iOS endpoints.
