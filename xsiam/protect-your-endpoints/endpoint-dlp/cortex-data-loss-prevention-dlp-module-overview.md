# Cortex Data Loss Prevention (DLP) module overview

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Prerequisite

* Endpoint DLP add-on license
* Cortex agent 9.1 and above for Windows and macOS
{% endhint %}

The Cortex Data Loss Prevention (DLP) module provides a unified, flexible solution for preventing the exfiltration of sensitive data. It continuously enforces policies on endpoints (even offline) across web, local, and USB channels, protecting both on-premises and cloud environments.

After endpoint DLP is enabled, the DLP module is downloaded to all eligible endpoints.

This highlights Cortex's benefit of proactively safeguarding sensitive information. Future enhancements will include data-at-rest discovery, adaptive policies, and broader channel support.

<summary>User roles and permissions</summary>

Cortex DLP now includes two new out-of-the-box roles:

* Data security admin: Defines the policy and its key components, including applications.
* Data security viewer: Reviews and analyzes DLP-related issues.

Refer to the [Personas workflow for DLP](personas-workflow-for-dlp) for steps on how to create and manage endpoint DLP in your environment.

Verify that the user has the correct permissions in the linked role for access and configuration permissions to DLP capabilities.

1. Go to **Settings** → **Configuration** → **Access Management** → **Roles**.
2. Go to the relevant role, right-click and select **Edit Role**, and in the **Components** tab, verify under **Data Security** that the settings are configured to **View/Edit**.
