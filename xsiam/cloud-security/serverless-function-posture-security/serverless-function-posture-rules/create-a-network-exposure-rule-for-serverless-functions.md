# Create a network exposure rule for serverless functions

Network Exposure rules allow you to monitor and control the network accessibility of your serverless functions, identifying configurations that might expose them to unwanted external traffic.

1. Under **Posture Management**, select **Rules & Policies** → **Cloud Security (under Rules)** → **click Create Rule**.
2. Select **Network Exposure**.
3. On the **Overview** step of the **Create Network Exposure Rule** wizard.
   1. Fill in these fields:
      * **Rule Name**: (required): A user-provided to identify the rule
      * **Description** (required): A description of the rule
      * **Severity** (required): Select the severity level. Only findings with this exact severity level will trigger this rule. Findings with different severity levels will be ignored
      * **Labels**: (optional): Assign labels to categorize and organize the rule based on specific criteria or attributes. Labels help in easily identifying and filtering rules
   2. Click Next.
4. Define the logic for the rule on the **Rule Logic** step of the wizard.
   1. Fill in these fields:
      * **Source Network**: Select the source network to be evaluated by this rule. Options:
        * **Untrusted** (default): all internet IPs
        * A specific IP or CIDR range: Select **Show Advanced Settings** and fill in the following fields:
          * **Protocol/Port**: Specify the protocols and ports that will generate findings if exposed. For example: tcp/80, tcp/20-23, tcp/80, tcp/443
          * **Host State**: Configure the rule to alert on either active (running) or potentially exposed (stopped) workloads
          * **Use External Probe Validation**: When enabled, network scanning verifies internet exposure and provides additional context (protocols, ports, services). Disabling it relies on configuration alone, which may increase inaccurate findings
      * **Destination Asset Type**: Select **Serverless Function** as the asset type to be evaluated in the rule
      * **Cloud Service Provider**: Select the target cloud provider in which the rule will be evaluated (AWS, GCP, Azure)
   2. Click Done.
