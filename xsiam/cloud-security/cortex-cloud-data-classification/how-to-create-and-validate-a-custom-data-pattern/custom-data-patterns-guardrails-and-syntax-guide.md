This guide explains the capabilities and limitations of creating custom classifiers. Understanding these guardrails will help you create effective and functional data patterns.

### Guardrails

This section details the configuration rules, the logic behind these requirements, and how they affect pattern detection.

#### One regex per detector

* **Rule:** Each custom detector supports a single regular expression.
* **Why:** This simplifies the configuration and ensures that each detector has a clear, singular purpose.
* **Impact:** If you need to match multiple different patterns (for example, different formats of an ID), you need to create separate custom detectors for each pattern or combine them into a single regex using the alternation operator | (pipe), provided that this does not violate complexity limits. Example: `format1|format2`

#### Context words are mandatory

* **Rule:** You must provide at least one context word for your classifier.
* **Why:** The Data Classification engine uses context words as a first-pass filter. It only runs your potentially regular expression (regex) if one of the context words is found in the proximity you defined. This ensures high performance across large datasets.
* **Impact:** If you don't provide context words, or if the context words don't appear near your target data, the regex does not execute, and no match is found.

#### Avoid start-of-string and end-of-string anchors (^ and $)

* **Rule:** Do not use the start-of string and end-of-string `^` or `$` anchors.
* **Why:** In many regex engines, `^` and `$` match the start or end of a line. However, in Cortex Cloud Data Classification, they match the start or end of the entire text being scanned. Since your target data ( such as an ID or key) is usually embedded in the middle of a file or sentence, using these causes the match to fail.
* **Impact:**
  * `^[A-Z]{2}\d{5}` fails to find "AB12345".
  * `[A-Z]{2}\d{5}$` fails to find "AB12345".

#### Avoid using lookaround and backreference entities

* **Rule:** Cortex Cloud Data Classification does not support the following:
  * **lookahead** `((?=...))`
  * **lookbehind** `((?&lt;=...))`
  * **backreference** `(\1)`
* **Why:** Using the `lookaround` and `backreference` entities can lead to exponential execution time. Cortex Cloud Data Classification allows `lookaround` entities using the context words, and it uses the Rust regex engine, which guarantees linear time execution `O(n)` to prevent ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks and to ensure predictable performance.
* **Impact:** You must rewrite patterns to avoid these constructs. For example, instead of using `lookbehind` to ensure that a prefix exists, include the prefix in the match and use a capturing group for the data you want to extract.

#### Regex complexity limits

* **Rule:** Cortex Cloud Data Classification enforces limits on regex complexity to prevent performance issues.
  * **Unbound repetitions:** If possible, avoid unbounded repetitions such as `.*` or `.+` or ensure that they are not nested.
  * **Nesting depth:** Deeply nested patterns, such as `((((a)b)c)d))`, are limited.
  * **Branching:** Too many alternations (such as `a|b|c|...`) or nested alternations can trigger validation errors.
* **Why:** Complex patterns with excessive nesting or branching can lead to "combinatorial explosion," where the number of possible matches grows exponentially, causing the scanner to hang or crash.
* **Impact:** If your regex is too complex, Cortex Cloud Data Classification rejects it with a validation error. In short, simplify your pattern by reducing nesting or breaking it into smaller components.

### Syntax: Supported vs. unsupported

This section lists the specific regular expression characters and groupings that are allowed or restricted for use in custom patterns.

* **Supported syntax**
  * **Character classes**: `[a-z], [0-9], \d, \w, \s`
  * **Groupings**:
    * **Capturing**: `(...)`
    * **Noncapturing**: `(?:...)`
  * **Alternation**: Pipe `|` (OR operator). Example: `cat|dog`
  * **Case insensitivity**: `(?i)` flag. Example: `(?i)pattern` matches "Pattern", "PATTERN", and so on.
* **Unsupported syntax**
  * **lookahead**: `(?=...), (?!...)`
  * **lookbehind**: `(?&lt;=...), (?&lt;!...)`
  * **backreference**: `\1, \2`

### Examples: Do's and don'ts

#### Example 1: Matching an ID (anchors)

**Goal**: Match an ID that starts with 2 letters followed by 5 digits (such as "XY12345").

*   **Do**: `[a-zA-Z]{2}\d{5}`

    Reason: This allows the pattern to match anywhere in the text.
*   **Don't**: `^[a-zA-Z]{2}\d{5}` or `[a-zA-Z]{2}\d{5}$`

    Reason: The `^` and `$` anchors force the match to be at the start or end of the entire file. However, it misses IDs inside a sentence or JSON object.

#### Example 2: Case insensitivity

**Goal**: Match the word "Confidential" regardless of case.

*   **Do**: `(?i)confidential`

    Reason: The `(?i)` flag enables case-insensitive matching for the pattern.
*   **Don't**: `[C|c][O|o][N|n]...`

    Reason: This is inefficient and hard to read.

#### Example 3: Testing your pattern

**Goal**: Verify that your pattern works in the **Test Data Pattern** box.

*   **Do**: If a test fails, clear the **Test Data Pattern** box completely and retype or paste the test string.

    Reason: This ensures that the test environment resets to a stateless condition before processing the new input.
* **Don't**: Edit the existing text in the test box and expect immediate results if previous tests failed.
