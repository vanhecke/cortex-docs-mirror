# What is Cortex Cloud AI Security?

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is included with a Cortex XSIAM Premium license. It is also included with any other Cortex XSIAM license that has the Cloud Posture Security or Cloud Runtime Security add-on.
{% endhint %}

Cortex Cloud AI Security provides:

* **Comprehensive Visibility:** Obtains a full picture of AI components, including models, agents, data flows, and infrastructure across all cloud environments. This broad visibility ensures that every AI asset is accounted for and continuously monitored, reducing blind spots in the AI ecosystem.
* **Full supply chain protection:** Maps the dependencies between data, models, and cloud resources to remediate risks such as poisoned datasets or unsanctioned models. Maintains the integrity of your AI bill of materials (AI-BOM).
* **Detailed asset inventory:** Access an in-depth inventory of all AI assets, enriched with contextual details. This deep insight into each asset’s specifics and functionalities facilitates a better understanding and more effective management of these resources.
* **Advanced risk assessment:** Proactively identifies and issues alerts on misconfigurations and security flaws in AI assets. Cortex Cloud AI Security employs sophisticated detection mechanisms to tackle risks associated specifically with AI, managing permissions, and ensures robust security practices are upheld throughout the AI supply chain.
* **Dynamic risk prioritization:** Utilizes insights into data sensitivity and the broader security context to effectively understand and prioritize risks. This strategic approach enables organizations to target and mitigate the most critical threats swiftly, thereby enhancing the overall security landscape.
* **Governance and control:** Implements comprehensive guardrails and controls for AI models both during development and in production. Ensures that AI assets operate within defined security parameters, reducing the likelihood of security breaches and data leaks.
* **Compliance assurance:** Regularly tests AI systems against emerging AI regulations and industry standards, such as the OWASP _Top 10 for Large Language Models (LLMs)_. Gets clear guidelines on corrective actions needed to achieve full compliance and ensures that AI assets align with both current and future regulations.

These benefits ensure that using Cortex Cloud AI Security can maintain a robust security posture across your AI environment, proactively manage risks, and align with compliance and internal security policies.

#### Cortex Cloud AI Security overview dashboard

The Cortex Cloud AI Security overview dashboard serves as the central hub for information on the AI ecosystem within the organization. It provides a comprehensive overview of AI security posture and is designed to help users quickly access relevant information. The layout and organization of the dashboard are tailored to guide you in understanding the AI environment and determining the next steps to take for effective AI governance.

The following image shows the Cortex Cloud AI Security dashboard:

#### AI assets inventory

You can view all AI assets in your environment, regardless of deployment mode or cloud provider. Connected assets are discovered, contextualized, and presented with detailed information. You can dive deeper into the asset context as required.

Cortex Cloud AI Security provides visibility into how sensitive data is being utilized and potentially impacted by AI systems. By identifying the AI assets that interact with sensitive data, the platform helps ensure that appropriate protection protocols are applied where most needed, thereby enhancing overall data security and reducing the risk of data breaches and leakage.

#### AI security issues

Cortex Cloud AI Security provides risk assessment for the supported AI assets, with risk rules created by the research team. These risk rules are designed to detect misconfigurations and security flaws in AI assets and send alerts about them. In addition to the provided default risk rules, Cortex Cloud AI Security also supports custom risk rule creation, so you can codify and integrate internal policies into the Cortex Cloud AI Security risk engine, streamlining your remediation efforts.

When insecure models and deployments are used, several types of attacks can occur, such as the following:

* **Data Poisoning Attacks:** In "Training Data Poisoning", malicious actors manipulate the training data to introduce biases or vulnerabilities into the model, causing it to make incorrect or harmful predictions.
* **Model Inversion Attacks:** Attackers can infer sensitive information about the training data by querying the model, potentially leading to data breaches and loss of intellectual property.
* **Adversarial Attacks:** Crafted inputs can deceive the model into making incorrect predictions, which is particularly dangerous in critical applications like autonomous driving or medical diagnosis.
* **Evasion Attacks:** Evasion attacks are a prevalent threat to machine learning models during inference. This type of attack involves crafting inputs that appear normal to humans but are misclassified by machine learning systems. For instance, an adversary might alter a few pixels in an image prior to submission, causing an image recognition system to misidentify it.
* **Model Extraction Attacks:** Attackers can approximate a model's functionality by repeatedly prompting it, effectively stealing the intellectual property and potentially using it for malicious purposes.
* **Data Leakage:** If a model unintentionally reveals sensitive information it was trained on or data that is used in inference, it can lead to breaches of confidential or personal data.
* **Model Manipulation:** Unauthorized access to the model can allow attackers to alter its parameters or behavior, leading to compromised functionality and trustworthiness.
* **Inference Attacks:** Attackers exploit the model to deduce whether specific data was part of the training set, potentially exposing sensitive information.

These types of attacks highlight the importance of implementing robust security measures, as outlined by the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) _Top 10 Risk & Mitigations for LLMs and Gen AI Apps_.
