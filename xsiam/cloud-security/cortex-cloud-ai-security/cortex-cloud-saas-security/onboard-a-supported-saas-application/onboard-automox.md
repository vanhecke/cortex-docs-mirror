# Onboard Automox

For SaaS Security to detect posture risks in your Automox instance, you must onboard your Automox instance to Cortex. Through the onboarding process, SaaS Security connects to an Automox API by using an API key that you generate from the Automox console. After connecting to the Automox API, SaaS Security scans your Automox instance for misconfigured settings and account risks.

The supported Automox account plans for SaaS Security scans are:

* Automate Essentials
* Automate Enterprise

To access your Automox instance, SaaS Security requires the following information, which you specify during the onboarding process.

| API Key         | A unique, alphanumeric string that you generate from an Automox account. SaaS Security uses the key to authenticate to the Automox API. The API key inherits the permissions of the Automox account. |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Organization ID | A unique identifier for your organization within the Automox platform.                                                                                                                               |

To onboard your Automox instance, complete the following actions.

***

### Step 1: Generate and Copy an API Key for Your Organization

1. Identify the Automox account that you will use to create the API key.

Required Permissions: The account that you use to generate the API key must have the following permissions that SaaS Security requires. To adhere to the principle of least privilege, create a custom role with this exact set of permissions and assign it to the account. The API key inherits these permissions.

* Personal API Keys: Manage
* Organization: Read & Manage
* All API Keys: Read & List
* Groups: Read
* Patch Policy Management: Read
* User Management: Read

2. Using the credentials of the account you identified, log in to the [Automox console](https://console.automox.com).
3. Locate the settings menu icon (⋮) in the upper-right corner of the console and select Secrets & Keys.
4. On the Secrets & Keys page, scroll to the API Keys section and click Add.
5. Fill out the fields of the Create an API Key dialog and click Create. Automox adds the new key to the list of API keys.
6. From the API key's entry in the list, click the copy icon to copy the key. Paste the key into a text file.

Note: Do not continue to the next step unless you have copied the API key. You must provide this key to SaaS Security during the onboarding process.

### Step 2: Identify Your Organization ID

1. Click the organization selector icon in the upper-right corner of the console and select Manage Orgs and Users.
2. On the Setup and Configuration page, select the Organizations tab.
3. From the list of organizations, copy your Organization ID and paste it into a text file.

Note: Do not continue to the next step unless you have copied the Organization ID. You must provide this information to SaaS Security during the onboarding process.

### Step 3: Connect SaaS Security to Your Automox Instance

By adding an Automox app in Cortex, you enable SaaS Security to connect to your Automox instance.

1. Log in to Cortex.
2. Select **Settings > Data Sources and Integrations > Add New**. You can use the Search bar to find the app you want to connect to.
3. Click the Automox tile.
4. Under **Capabilities**, Enter a Name for your application.
5. Select Security Posture under Default Capabilities and click Next.
6. Under **Connections**, provide the API key and Organization ID.
7. Under **Configurations**, select a **Sync Interval**. Choose a meaningful **Tag** to distinguish between various applications in different environments.
8. Click **Next** to complete the onboarding validation process.
