# Manage Global BIOC Rules

**Manage Global BIOC Rules**

Global BIOC rules are detection rules created by Cortex and distributed to the tenants. Cortex XSIAM checks automatically for the latest update of global BIOC rules and applies them. If there are no new global BIOC rules, Cortex XSIAM displays a content status of `Content up to date` next to the BIOC rules table heading. A dot to the left of the rule name indicates a global BIOC rule.

To see which rules are pushed by Palo Alto Networks, display the optional **Source** field.

<summary>Retrieve the latest global BIOC rules</summary>

1. Navigate to **Threat Management** → **Detection Rules** → **BIOC**.
2.  To view the content details, hover over the status **Content up to date**, to show the global rules version number and the date the global rules were checked.

    The content status displays the date when the content was last updated, either automatically or manually by an administrator.
3.  If the status displays **Could not check update**, click the status to check for updates manually.

    The last updated date changes when the download is successful.
