# Indicator investigation

Cortex XSIAM enables you to centralize and manage every aspect of your TIM investigation. Create, extract, and enrich indicators and explore their relationships to gain deeper insights.

After you start ingesting indicators into Cortex XSIAM, you can start your investigation, including creating indicators, adding indicators to an issue, extracting indicators, exporting indicators, etc.

When investigating an indicator, you can see the following tabs:

*   **Summary**

    View verdict, enrich, expire, delete and exclude the indicator, add relationships, view related issues, and add comments. Add or remove tags, which can help classify known threats. For example, you may want to group specific malware indicators that are part of ransomware, such as trojan or loader.
*   **Additional Details**

    Add or view any community notes for sharing and any custom details.

When investigating an indicator, you can perform actions on the indicator, such as:

| Action                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enrich an indicator            | You can view detailed information about the indicator (WHOIS information for example), using third-party integrations such as VirusTotal and IPinfo. For more information, see [Extract and enrich an indicator](indicator-investigation/extract-and-enrich-an-indicator).                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Expire an indicator            | You may want to expire an indicator to filter out less relevant issues, allowing analysts to focus on active threats. For more information, see [Expire an indicator](indicator-investigation/expire-an-indicator).                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Manage indicator relationships | Indicator relationships are connections between different indicators. These relationships can be IP addresses related to one another, domains impersonating legitimate domains, etc. Relationships are created from threat intel feeds and enrichment integrations that support the automatic creation of relationships. For more information, see [Manage indicator relationships](indicator-investigation/manage-indicator-relationships). |
| Delete and exclude indicators  | Indicators added to an exclusion list are disregarded by the system and are not created or involved in automated flows. For more information, see [Delete and exclude indicators](indicator-investigation/delete-and-exclude-indicators).                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
