# Indicator management

**Indicator management**

Indicators are artifacts associated with security issues and are an essential part of the case management and remediation process. They help correlate issues, create hunting operations, and enable you to easily analyze cases and reduce Mean Time to Response (MTTR).

**Indicators**

Displays a list of indicators added to Cortex XSIAM, where you can perform several indicator actions.

You can perform the following actions on the **XSIAM Indicators** page.

| Action                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
