# Indicator field structure

Cortex XSIAM IOC fields are based on the STIX 2.1 specifications. These fields provide a guideline for the fields we recommend you maintain within an IOC. None of the fields are mandatory, except the value field. Maintaining this field structure enables you to share and export IOCs to additional threat intel based systems as well as to other cybersecurity devices.

Like STIX, Cortex XSIAM indicators are divided into two categories, STIX Domain Objects (SDOs) and STIX Cyber-observable Objects (SCOs). The category determines which fields are presented in the layout of that specific IOC. In Cortex XSIAM, all SCOs can be used in a relationship with either SDOs or SCOs.

Each IOC table of fields is separated into three parts:

* System fields - Fields created and managed by Cortex XSIAM.
* Custom core fields - Custom fields shared by all IOCs of the same time (SDO or SCO). Fields may be empty.
* Custom unique fields - Fields unique to a specific type of IOC. If a user associates more fields with the IOC, the additional fields are also treated as unique.

<summary>Account</summary>

Similar to STIX User Account Object, this indicator type represents a user account in various platforms such as operating system, social media accounts, and Active Directory. The value for the object is usually the username for logging in.

<summary>Attack Pattern</summary>

Attack patterns are a type of TTP (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures) that describe ways adversaries attempt to compromise targets. Attack patterns help categorize attacks, generalize specific attacks to the patterns that they follow, and provide detailed information about how attacks are performed. An example of an attack pattern is spear phishing, where an attacker sends a carefully crafted email message with the intent of getting the target to click a link or open an attachment that delivers malware. Attack patterns can also be more specific, such as spear phishing by a particular threat actor (for example, an email saying the target won a contest).

<summary>Campaign</summary>

A campaign is a grouping of adversarial behaviors that describes a set of malicious activities or attacks (sometimes called waves) that occur over a period of time against a specific set of targets. Campaigns usually have well defined objectives and may be part of an intrusion set.

Campaigns are often attributed to an intrusion set and threat actors. The threat actors may reuse known infrastructure from the intrusion set or may set up new infrastructure specifically for conducting that campaign.

Campaigns can be characterized by their objectives and the issues they cause, people or resources they target, and the resources (such as infrastructure, intelligence, and malware, tools) they use.

For example, a campaign can describe a crime syndicate's attack using a specific variant of malware and new C2 servers against the executives of ACME Bank during the summer of 2020 to gain secret information about an upcoming merger with another bank.

<summary>Course of action</summary>

A course of action is an action taken either to prevent an attack or to respond to an attack that is in progress. It may describe technical, automatable responses (applying patches, reconfiguring firewalls), but can also describe higher level actions such as employee training or policy changes. For example, a course of action to mitigate a vulnerability could describe applying the patch that fixes it.

<summary>CVE</summary>

To preserve backward compatibility, our vulnerability indicator is referred to as CVE, but it is equivalent to the Vulnerability object defined by STIX. Unlike STIX, in TIM the object is identified by its CVE number. A vulnerability is a weakness or defect in the requirements, designs, or implementations of the computational logic (code) found in software and some hardware components (firmware) that can be directly exploited to negatively impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of that system.

<summary>Infrastructure</summary>

The Infrastructure SDO represents a type of TTP and describes any systems, software services and any associated physical or virtual resources that support some purpose (for example, C2 servers used as part of an attack, a device or server that is part of a defense, and database servers targeted by an attack). While elements of an attack can be represented by other SDOs or SCOs, the Infrastructure SDO represents a named group of related data that constitutes the infrastructure.

<summary>Intrusion set</summary>

An intrusion set is a grouped set of adversarial behaviors and resources with common properties that is believed to be orchestrated by a single organization. An intrusion set may capture multiple campaigns or other activities that are all tied together by shared attributes indicating a commonly known or unknown threat actor. New activity can be attributed to an intrusion set even if the threat actors behind the attack are not known. Threat actors can move from supporting one intrusion set to supporting another, or they may support multiple intrusion sets.

Whereas a campaign is a set of attacks over a period of time against a specific set of targets to achieve an objective, an intrusion set is the entire attack package and may be used over a very long period of time in multiple campaigns to achieve potentially multiple purposes.

<summary>Malware</summary>

Malware is a type of TTP that represents malicious code. It generally refers to a program that is inserted into a system, usually covertly. The intent is to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim's data, applications, or operating system (OS) or otherwise annoy or disrupt the victim.

<summary>Tool</summary>

Tools are legitimate software used by threat actors to perform attacks. Knowing how and when threat actors use such tools can help understand how campaigns are executed. Unlike malware, these tools or software packages are often found on a system and have legitimate purposes for power users, system administrators, network administrators, or even regular users. Remote access tools such as RDP and network scanning tools such as Nmap are examples of tools that may be used by a threat actor during an attack.
