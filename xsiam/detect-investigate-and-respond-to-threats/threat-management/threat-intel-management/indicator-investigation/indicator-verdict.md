# Indicator verdict

An indicator’s verdict is assigned according to the verdict returned by the source with the highest reliability, where reliability is scaled based on the [Admiralty Source and Information Reliability Matrix](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-Admiralty-Code-for-Confidence_fig3_351655780). In cases where multiple sources with the same reliability score return a different verdict for the indicator, the worst verdict is taken. Indicators are assigned the following verdicts:

* 0: Unknown
* 1: Benign
* 2: Suspicious
* 3: Malicious

In the UI, you can manually set the verdict when creating or editing an indicator. If you manually changed the indicator’s verdict in the UI and want to recalculate it according to enrichment integrations, set the verdict to `Unknown` and then enrich the indicator. If you run indicator enrichment without setting the verdict to `Unknown`, the indicator is enriched but the manually set verdict is not changed.

You can also manually set the verdict by running `!setIndicator` or `!setIndicators` in the CLI (for example in the Playground), but if you set the verdict to `Unknown` the system will not overwrite it.

Source reliability

The reliability of an intelligence data source influences the verdict of an indicator and the values for indicator fields when merging indicators. Indicator fields are merged according to the source reliability hierarchy, which means that when there are two different values for a single indicator field, the field will be populated with the value provided by the source with the highest reliability score.

In rare cases, two sources with the same reliability score might return different values for the same indicator field. In these cases, the field is populated with the most recently provided source, unless the field is verdict. If two sources have the same reliability score and return different values for the verdict field, the worse verdict is used.

For the field types Tags and Multi-select, all values are appended, and nothing is overridden.

Different verdicts from integrations

In this example, two third-party integrations, VirusTotal and AlienVault, return a different verdict for the same indicator. The indicator’s verdict will be Malicious because VirusTotal’s reliability score is higher than AlienVault.

| Integration | Reliability             | Verdict   | Final Verdict |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| VirusTotal  | C - Fairly reliable     | Malicious | Malicious     |
| AlienVault  | D- Not usually reliable | Benign    |               |

In this example, two sources with the same verdict score return a different verdict for the same indicator. The indicator’s verdict will be Malicious because when two sources have the same reliability, the worse verdict applies.

| Integration | Reliability          | Verdict   | Final Verdict |
| ----------- | -------------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| TAXII Feed  | B - Usually reliable | Malicious | Malicious     |
| CSV Feed    | B - Usually reliable | Benign    |               |
