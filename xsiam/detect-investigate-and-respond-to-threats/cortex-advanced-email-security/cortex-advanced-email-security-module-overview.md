The Cortex Advanced Email Security module provides a scalable detection, investigation, and response layer over cloud-hosted email environments. It connects directly to supported email platforms via secure API integrations to ingest rich message-level and identity-related telemetry.

Unlike legacy approaches that rely on inline enforcement, this module operates passively, requiring no mail flow changes, and is optimized for modern, distributed email infrastructures. After the module is connected, it continuously collects data across messages, artifacts (e.g., links, attachments), user identities, and authentication metadata. This data is processed through a multi-layered analysis engine designed to surface early-stage threats, campaign patterns, and high-risk behaviors.

This document provides detailed technical guidance for onboarding, configuring, and operating the module. It is intended for security administrators and operators with access to email platform APIs, and familiarity with foundational email security concepts for example, SPF/DKIM/DMARC, MIME structure, phishing tactics.
