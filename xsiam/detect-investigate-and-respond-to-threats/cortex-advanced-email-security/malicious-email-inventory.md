# Malicious Email Inventory

{% hint style="info" %}
### Notice

Requires the Advanced Email Security module.
{% endhint %}

Simplify your email threat triage with the Malicious Emails Inventory. Designed specifically for malicious email analysis, this dedicated view provides immediate context on which emails were suspicious and why emails were flagged, enabling you to view and act on malicious emails from a timeframe you select, and pivot to other views for forensic investigations and remediation actions.

{% hint style="info" %}
Find the inventory under **Modules** → **Email Security** → **Malicious Emails Inventory**.
{% endhint %}

Use the three widgets at the top of the screen to get an overview of the malicious emails that were detected by the module.

If you filter any of the widgets or the table, all the widgets and the table on the page are updated accordingly.
