# Cortex Cloud Command Center

Cortex Cloud Command Center serves as your centralized landing experience designed to provide immediate visibility into your security posture and current environmental status. It presents a high-level summary of your account health, asset distribution, and assets at risk to help you get a snapshot of your compliance and vulnerability posture. Through a unified view of your security domains, you can monitor open threat cases and posture issues sorted by severity and impact. This interface provides direct pathways to your inventory searches, operational dashboards, graphs, and compliance reports while highlighting top-priority issues.

The following image shows the Cortex Cloud Command Center dashboard:

### **Interactive Navigation and Drilldown**

All metrics, status indicators, and list items in Cortex Cloud Command Center are interactive. Selecting a high-level summary element opens a filtered view of the underlying data, allowing you to move from environmental overviews to your asset inventories, threat cases, or remediation workflows.

### **Environmental Health and Inventory**

This section displays your cloud footprint and its operational status.

* **Provider health summary**: You can monitor your account counts and percentage health across cloud providers to verify scanning status.
* **Asset class distribution**: This view categorizes your infrastructure into classes such as AI, Compute, Identity, API, Data, and Network, displaying the total count and the number of your assets currently at risk.

### **Risk and Threat Analysis**

These widgets centralize your active security investigations and prioritize your response efforts.

The Cortex case engine consolidates open issues into open cases, which are further analyzed and displayed as follows:

* **Active Threat Cases**: This component displays your total open threat cases by severity and provides a trend analysis of your created and resolved cases
* **Posture Cases**: You can review your Posture cases, categorized by severity, with indicators for available manual and automated remediations.

### **Prioritized Risk and Compliance Summaries**

The lower sections of Cortex Cloud Command Center aggregate your high-impact risks and regulatory status to assist in cross-functional prioritization.

* **Vulnerability Summary**: This section displays a quantitative count of unique risky vulnerability issues, categorized by critical and high severity, weaponized exploits, and available fixes.
* **Top Risky Vulnerabilities**: You can access a prioritized list of specific vulnerabilities sorted by CVSS and EPSS scores, which includes the publish date and the number of your impacted assets for each entry.
* **Compliance Summary**: This view provides your overall compliance score and a breakdown of your compliance standards by score.
* **Standards Status**: You can monitor the specific assessment percentage for individual standards, such as ISO-27001, and see the total number of controls assessed within each framework.

In addition, navigation links are provided, enabling you to select **Manage Vulnerabilities** or **View Compliance Center** to transition from these summaries to your specialized management environments.
