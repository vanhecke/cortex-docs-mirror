# Manage Risk Scores

An risk score is a dynamic risk metric, typically ranging from 10 to 100 though it can go higher with custom modifiers, assigned to users and hosts. It acts as an aggregate indicator of how much security risk a specific identity or machine currently represents.

### Note

Customers with the Identity Threat Module add-on have access to risk scores.

Cortex XSIAM aggregates Workday and Active Directory data to create a list of user and host assets within your network. A user or host risk card is generated only after an alert associated with that specific entity is triggered. Cortex XSIAM calculates the score by summing the scores of the cases and alerts that the specific asset is implicated in.

For users, the underlying data driving these scores heavily relies on authentication logs, such as VPNs and Single Sign-On events. Cortex XSIAM aggregates this risk by the exact hostname or username. If multiple alerts map to the exact same name, the score aggregates under a single Risk View.

Risk scores act as an important input for the broader alert ecosystem. The Cortex SmartScore algorithm factors in the Risk Score, meaning a critical alert on an asset with a low risk score might be given a lower overall SmartScore, while minor alerts on highly critical assets might be elevated.

You can view the latest scores by navigating to **Inventory** → **Assets** → **Risk Scores**. This page provides a birds-eye view of your riskiest entities. Use the toggle in the page header to switch between the **Users** and **Hosts** tabs. Access to the **Hosts** tab and the associated **Risk Management** dashboard requires the Identity Threat Module add-on and Analytics to be enabled.

To include system users in the table, such as administrators or NT authority, select the **Include System Users** checkbox. From the table, you can filter and review your assets. To investigate further, right-click on a selected host or user and click **Open User Risk View** or **Open Host Risk View** to track the score trend over time.

### Note

Some **User Associated Insights** may not appear as part of the **User Associated Incidents** due to the insight generation mechanism. For example, when an insight related to one of the assets in an incident is generated a few days after the associated incident, the insight may not be associated with the incident.
