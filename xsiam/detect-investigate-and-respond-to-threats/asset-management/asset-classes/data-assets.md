# Data assets

The data assets inventory provides a centralized repository for all data assets within your environment. Powered by theData Security (DSPM) module, it provides continuous visibility into where sensitive data resides, how it is used, and its exposure risk.

### Note

The data assets inventory requires a Cortex XSIAM Premium license, or a base Cortex XSIAM license that includes the Cloud Posture Security or Cloud Runtime Security add-on.

Navigate to **Inventory** → **All Assets** → **Data** → **All Data Assets** to view your data landscape. The top of the page features interactive widgets that summarize your risk:

* **Assets at risk:** Displays a bar with various risk levels. You can hover your mouse to see the number of risks for each level.
* **Data stored in AWS, Azure, and GCP:** Displays the number of data assets located within each specific cloud platform. You can click any of these cloud platform icons to dynamically filter the inventory results below, and click them again to remove the filter.
* **Sensitive Assets:** Displays the number of assets containing sensitive data profiles.
* **Sensitive Assets Open to World:** Highlights sensitive assets that are publicly accessible.

You can filter the inventory to focus on specific data categories: **Databases** (structured data), **Storage Buckets** (folders and files), or **Disks** (VM disks like AWS EBS or Azure Managed Disks).

**Data asset details**

Clicking an asset in the inventory opens a detailed asset card with the following tabs:

* **Overview:** Provides highlights, properties, and identities with access to the resource, if any are found.
* **Identity:** Displays an aggregated view of the identities and permissions associated with the asset, including an interactive graph of the access paths.
* **Configurations:** Displays any Cloud Configuration Issues detected on the asset and provides the raw Asset Configuration JSON.
* **Data:** Provides an overview of the displayed asset and its associated risks, including the presence of Data Profiles like Financial or PCI and Data Patterns like credit card numbers.
* **Compliance:** Shows the Overall Compliance Score, a breakdown of Controls by Status, and a detailed list of compliance results based on industry standards.
* **Objects:** Provides a granular list of the objects stored within the asset and information pertaining to their contents.
* **AI Ecosystem:** Visualizes the Asset Story, providing a topological map of how the data asset interacts with connected AI components. This tab does not appear on every data asset. It only appears dynamically if Cortex XSIAM detects that the data asset is actively functioning as part of an AI supply chain, such as acting as an inference dataset or training dataset connected to an AI model

**Backups**

Alongside databases, storage buckets, and disks, the data asset class also provides an inventory of your environment's backups, such as AWS Backup resources. Navigate to **Inventory** → **All Assets** → **Data** → **Backups**.
