# Website assets

Cortex XSIAM websites data extends Attack Surface Management (ASM) protection by identifying insecure websites, web components, and technologies running on your managed and unmanaged web assets. Cortex XSIAM scans your public-facing websites, creating a continuously updated inventory of your web assets, including the server software and other technologies powering your web applications.

Websites data in Cortex XSIAM enables you to accomplish the following:

* Develop a single source of truth for all of your organization's web inventory
* Track and monitor your risk due to third-party libraries
* Continuously discover and monitor external web application inventory and third-party technologies
* Identify insecure and misconfigured websites, vulnerable technologies, and dependencies
* Improve security ratings by identifying sites failing security best practices

**The difference between websites and external services**

In Cortex XSIAM, external services are public-facing network services; for example, an RDP server or an HTTP server. Websites represent the content and the software stack that was used to generate the website.

An HTTP service represents a single HTTP server (on-prem) or a cohesive group of HTTP servers (cloud). A website can be served by a single HTTP server or by multiple HTTP servers. Some of these HTTP servers could be hosted by a cloud provider, others on-prem. Generally, the relationship between HTTP services and websites can be described as follows:

* A website is supported by one or more HTTP services.
* A cloud HTTP service serves a single website.
* An on-prem HTTP service serves multiple websites, potentially hundreds.

**The difference between websites and domains**

A domain is simply the registration of a domain (for example, your organization might own www.example.com). You can have a domain without a website behind it. You can also have a domain that does not resolve to an IP address (which means it does not have a website behind it). Cortex XSIAM includes websites with a domain name or an IP address.

**Websites field descriptions**

The Websites page lists your websites in a table format that can be sorted, filtered, and downloaded. Some of the key fields are described in the table below.

| Field                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

**Website details**

Click a row in the Websites table to open the details page for that website. The following sections describe the information on the website details page.

**Site Details, Site Categories, Site Deployment Details**

Summarizes key information about the security of the website.

**Most Recent Screenshot**

A screenshot and link to the website to make it easier to investigate issues. If you don't see a screen shot, the website may have been down when we scanned the page or that access was blocked for our scanner (in which case you probably won't see any technologies listed under Technologies Used either). If the screenshot is incomplete (a blank or invalid layout), the page may have loaded too slowly—we take the screenshot six seconds after we request the page.

**Security Best Practices Analysis**

Provides an at-a-glance look at whether the website is following broadly accepted security best practices.

We perform only the relevant security best practice assessments on each website. For example, if a website redirects somewhere else, many of the security assessments are performed on the website the user is redirected to; only the Has HTTPS Enabled and Protocol Downgrade assessments are performed on the original website. And some security assessments don’t make sense on non-HTTPS websites (e.g. mixed content and HSTS header), so those assessments are not performed.

Some security best practice assessments are performed only on webpages without "transient errors". We consider a page to have a transient error if the HTTP status code is 405, 407, 408, 409 or greater than 411. In this case, we assume this is not a normal condition of the website and visiting the page later or in different conditions would yield a different result.

If we have no matching observation for an assessment, the assessment will not be displayed. For example, if https://acme.com has a single page with a 404 status code, the Mixed Content assessment would be performed (404 is not a transient error) but the X-Frame-Options assessment would not be.

The table below lists each of the security best practices, which websites and webpages the analysis is performed on, and the criteria we use to determine whether the website Passes or Fails the assessment.
