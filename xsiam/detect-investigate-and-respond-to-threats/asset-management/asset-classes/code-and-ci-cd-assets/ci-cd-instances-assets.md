# CI/CD instances assets

Cortex XSIAM discovers and inventories every CI/CD platform instance connected through active CI/CD integrations. Each CI/CD instance, whether a Jenkins server, GitHub Actions organization, GitLab CI group, Azure DevOps organization, or CircleCI organization, appears in the unified asset inventory as the platform-level entity that hosts and executes CI/CD pipelinesthe platform-level entity that hosts and executes CI/CD pipelines, carrying its identity metadata, CI/CD provider, platform version, instance URL, associated pipelines, and aggregated security health.

The CI/CD instance asset enables security teams to answer three questions about every CI/CD platform: what CI/CD platforms exist in the organization, what is the security posture of each platform, and which pipelines does each platform host.

### Note

Scope: The CI/CD instance asset represents a CI/CD platform instance discovered through an active CI/CD integration. The CI/CD instance asset captures the platform identity, version, and aggregated security postureplatform identity, version, and aggregated security posture across all pipelines hosted on the instance. The CI/CD instance asset does not represent individual CI/CD pipelines, pipeline runs, or build logs; individual pipelines are managed as a separate asset category (CI/CD Pipeline), and pipeline runs are tracked as scan events. The CI/CD instance asset does not represent VCS organizations; VCS organizations are managed under the VCS Organization asset category. The CI/CD pipeline asset represents a CI/CD pipeline definition associated with an onboarded repository or CI/CD integration. The CI/CD pipeline asset captures the pipeline configuration and build activitypipeline configuration and build activity as discovered through CI/CD scanning. The CI/CD pipeline asset does not represent individual pipeline runs, build logs, or CI/CD scan results; pipeline runs are tracked as scan events, and CI/CD risk findings are managed as issue types under Application Security Issues. The CI/CD pipeline asset does not represent CI/CD instances (e.g., Jenkins servers, GitHub organizations); CI/CD instances are managed as a separate asset category. The repository asset represents a VCS repository onboarded into Cortex XSIAM. The repository asset does not represent container image repositories, artifact registries, or cloud resource inventories; those asset categories are managed under the Compute and Cloud asset classes respectively.

The CI/CD instance asset is the foundational unit of platform-level CI/CD governance in Application Security. The CI/CD instance inventory provides the identity, provider context, platform version, aggregated security health, and pipeline visibility needed to manage every CI/CD platform as a governed asset; from discovery through remediation..

Core achievements

* **Instance discovery and identity:** Every CI/CD platform instance connected through a CI/CD integration is automatically discovered and registered in the unified asset inventory with a unique asset identifier, instance name, CI/CD provider, and instance URL. The CI/CD instance asset serves as the persistent identity record for the CI/CD platform
* **Instance-level security posture aggregation:** The CI/CD instance asset carries a security health profile aggregating CI/CD configuration risk findings from the CI/CD Risks scanner into a severity breakdown , the count of Critical, High, Medium, and Low issues. Instance-level aggregation provides a platform-wide security view that surfaces systemic configuration risks affecting all pipelines hosted on the instance
* **Pipeline aggregation and visibility:** The CI/CD instance asset provides direct visibility into all CI/CD pipelines hosted on the instance through the Pipelines tab, enabling platform-level pipeline management and cross-pipeline risk assessment
* **Coverage measurement:** The Coverage page tracks the scanning coverage status of CI/CD instances, enabling AppSec Managers to identify CI/CD platforms that are not actively monitored for configuration risks

**Functional responsibilities**

The CI/CD instance asset model facilitates a structured delegation between governance and operations:

* **AppSec managers (Governance):** Review the CI/CD instance inventory to identify platform-level configuration risks mapped to the OWASP CI/CD Top 10, assess provider-level coverage gaps, and evaluate the security posture of each CI/CD platform across the organization. Define unified policies using the CI/CD Configuration Scan policy type to enforce platform security standards across all onboarded CI/CD integrations. Prioritize remediation based on the concentration of Critical and High severity CI/CD risk findings per instance
* **AppSec practitioners (Operations):** Investigate CI/CD instance configuration risks and apply remediation guidance at the platform level. Navigate from the CI/CD instance to individual pipelines hosted on the instance to assess pipeline-level risks. Track remediation progress through resolution statuses and SLA compliance

**Relationship model**

Cortex XSIAM models the following relationships between the CI/CD instance asset and other asset categories to provide organizational context and aggregate security posture.

| Related asset category        | Inherited metadata and description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **VCS organization (Parent)** | The VCS organization that the CI/CD instance is associated with (for example, the GitHub organization that hosts GitHub Actions workflows). The CI/CD instance is attached to the VCS organization for organizational context. The CI/CD instance inherits the VCS organization provider type and organizational context |
| **CI/CD pipeline (Child)**    | CI/CD pipelines hosted and executed by the CI/CD instance. The instance aggregates security posture across all child pipelines. Child pipelines inherit the CI/CD instance provider type. The CI/CD instance aggregates pipeline-level CI/CD risk findings into the instance-level security health profile               |

**CI/CD instance assets inventory**

To view and manage CI/CD instance assets, you must have:

* At least one CI/CD integration active (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Azure Pipelines, Bitbucket Pipelines, CircleCI, Argo CD, AWS CodeBuild). CI/CD instances are discovered through active CI/CD integrations.
* At least one completed periodic scan that includes CI/CD configuration scanning results

To access repository assets, go to **Inventory**, select **All Assets** → **Code** → **CI/CD Instances**.

The CI/CD instances assets page includes a dashboard and an inventory table.

**CI/CD pipeline dashboard**

The dashboard includes a widget displaying the connected CI/CD providers (such as Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI) and the number of instances found in each provider. Selecting an item in the widget filters the table accordingly.

**CI/CD pipeline asset table**

The following table describes the default exposed properties of the CI/CD instance asset table. Select Menu Settings to view additional hidden properties.

| Property           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**           | The name of the CI/CD instance as discovered from the CI/CD integration. The Instance Name serves as the primary identifier for the CI/CD instance asset                                                   |
| **Provider**       | The CI/CD platform type hosting the instance (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure Pipelines, CircleCI), displayed with a provider icon                                                               |
| **URL**            | The direct URL to the CI/CD platform instance (for example, `https://jenkins.company.com`, `https://github.com/my-org`). The Instance URL enables direct navigation to the CI/CD platform console          |
| **Last Observed**  | The date and time when the CI/CD instance was most recently detected or synchronized by the active CI/CD integration. This timestamp helps verify that the integration is actively monitoring the platform |
| **Pipeline Count** | The total number of CI/CD pipelines hosted and executed by the CI/CD instance. This metric helps assess the scale, usage, and potential blast radius of the platform                                       |

**Filter and prioritize repositories**

The **CI/CD Instances** page displays a table of all CI/CD instance assets discovered through active CI/CD integrations. Apply filters to narrow results based on operational and security metadata.

To effectively reduce the organization CI/CD risk surface, apply the following filter combinations to prioritize remediation efforts:

* **Scope by CI/CD provider:** Use the **Provider** filter (or dashboard widget) to isolate the inventory by provider (for example, Jenkins or GitHub Actions) to evaluate provider-specific misconfigurations and enforce platform-level security standards
* **Assess blast radius by pipeline count:** Revie**w the Pipeline Count** attribute to identify the CI/CD instances hosting the largest number of pipelines. Securing these high-volume platforms effectively reduces risk across a broader segment of your development lifecycle

**Repository inventory table actions**

Right-click on a row in the inventory table to take the following actions:

* **Open in new tab**: Opens the description tab of the asset for detailed analysis of the issue
* **View asset data**: Opens a new pop-up window displaying the data retrieved for the asset during the most recent scan in either JSON (default) or tree view. This raw data provides a comprehensive and unformatted view of the asset's properties and attributes as they were initially ingested
* **Copy text to clipboard**: Copies the selected text to the clipboard
* **Copy entire row**: Copies the entire selected row data
* **Show/hide rows**: Stand on data in a row and filter the entire inventory to show or hide assets based on the selected attribute
