# CI/CD pipeline assets

Cortex XSIAM discovers and inventories every CI/CD pipeline associated with onboarded repositories and connected CI/CD integrations. Each pipeline detected through CI/CD scanning — whether a GitHub Actions workflow, GitLab CI pipeline, Jenkins pipeline, Azure Pipeline, Bitbucket Pipeline, or CircleCI pipeline, appears in the unified asset inventory as the governed bridge between source code and production deploymentsthe governed bridge between source code and production deployments, carrying its identity metadata, CI/CD provider, parent repository, CI/CD instance association, build activity, security health, and downstream deployment lineage.

The CI/CD pipeline asset enables security teams to answer three questions about every build and deploy workflow: what pipelines exist in the organization, what is the security posture of each pipeline configuration, and which production workloads does each pipeline deploy.

### Note

Scope: The CI/CD pipeline asset represents a CI/CD pipeline definition associated with an onboarded repository or CI/CD integration. The CI/CD pipeline asset captures the pipeline configuration and build activitypipeline configuration and build activity as discovered through CI/CD scanning. The CI/CD pipeline asset does not represent individual pipeline runs, build logs, or CI/CD scan results; pipeline runs are tracked as scan events, and CI/CD risk findings are managed as issue types under Application Security Issues. The CI/CD pipeline asset does not represent CI/CD instances (e.g., Jenkins servers, GitHub organizations); CI/CD instances are managed as a separate asset category.The repository asset represents a VCS repository onboarded into Cortex XSIAM. The repository asset does not represent container image repositories, artifact registries, or cloud resource inventories; those asset categories are managed under the Compute and Cloud asset classes respectively.

The CI/CD pipeline asset is the foundational unit of build and deploy governance in Cortex XSIAM Application Security. The CI/CD pipeline inventory provides the identity, provider context, build activity, security health, and deployment traceability needed to manage every pipeline as a governed asset, from discovery through remediation.

**Core achievements and use cases**

* **Pipeline discovery and identity:** Every CI/CD pipeline associated with an onboarded repository or CI/CD integration is automatically discovered and registered in the unified asset inventory with a unique asset identifier, pipeline name, CI/CD provider, CI/CD instance, parent repository, and pipeline definition file path. The CI/CD pipeline asset serves as the persistent identity record for the build and deploy workflow
* **Build activity tracking:** Each CI/CD pipeline asset carries build activity metadata including the last build execution timestamp and job activity status. The build activity profile enables operational monitoring, identifying active pipelines deploying to production versus dormant pipelines with no recent build activity
* **Code to cloud deployment lineage:** The CI/CD pipeline asset is the critical bridge node in the Code to cloud graph, linking the repository (code origin) to deployed runtime assets (container images, VM images, cloud resources). The lineage transforms the pipeline from an isolated workflow definition into a governed deployment component with production impact visibility
* **Coverage measurement:** The Command Center tracks the scanning coverage status of your CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Fully covered, Partially covered, or Uncovered). This coverage visibility enables AppSec Managers to identify blind spots in their CI/CD integrations and ensure that pipelines deploying critical workloads are actively monitored for configuration risks
* **CI/CD risk detection:** The CI/CD pipeline asset carries a security health profile aggregating CI/CD configuration risk findings from the CI/CD scanner into a severity breakdown — the count of Critical, High, Medium, and Low issues. CI/CD risk findings map to the OWASP CI/CD Top 10 framework, covering categories such as insufficient flow control, inadequate identity and access management, dependency chain abuse, poisoned pipeline execution, and insufficient credential hygiene

**Functional responsibilities**

The CI/CD pipeline asset model facilitates a structured delegation between governance and operations:

* **AppSec managers (Governance):** Review the CI/CD pipeline inventory to identify pipelines with systemic configuration risks mapped to the OWASP CI/CD Top 10, assess provider-level coverage gaps, and evaluate the ratio of pipelines deploying to production. Define unified policies using the CI/CD Configuration Scan policy type to enforce pipeline security standards across all onboarded CI/CD integrations. Prioritize remediation based on deployment status, internet exposure, business criticality, and the concentration of Critical and High severity CI/CD risk findings per pipeline
* **AppSec practitioners (Operations):** Investigate CI/CD pipeline configuration risks and apply remediation guidance directly in the pipeline definition file. Trace pipelines to deployed container images and cloud resources through the Code-to-Cloud graph to assess blast radius. Monitor build log scanning results for leaked secrets. Track remediation progress through resolution statuses and SLA compliance

**Relationship model**

Cortex XSIAM models the following relationships between the CI/CD pipeline asset and other asset categories to provide full supply chain visibility in the Code-to-Cloud relationship graph. The CI/CD pipeline connects the repository (where code is stored) to deployed runtime assets (where code runs in production).

| Related asset category           | Inherited metadata and description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Repository (Parent)**          | The repository containing the CI/CD pipeline definition file. The repository asset is the code origin of the pipeline in the Code to cloud graph. The CI/CD pipeline inherits the repository Applications association, Business Criticality, and tags                                                          |
| **CI/CD instance (Parent)**      | The CI/CD platform instance that hosts and executes the pipeline (such as Jenkins server, GitHub Actions organization). The CI/CD Instance asset aggregates security posture across all pipelines within the instance. The CI/CD pipeline inherits the CI/CD Instance provider type and organizational context |
| **CI/CD pipeline (Sibling)**     | Other CI/CD pipelines defined in the same parent repository or hosted on the same CI/CD instance. Sibling pipelines share the same repository Applications association and tags                                                                                                                                |
| **Container image (Downstream)** | Container images built by the CI/CD pipeline. The Code-to-Cloud graph traces the build lineage from the pipeline to the container image in the registry. The container image inherits the pipeline build context for deployment lineage tracking                                                               |
| **VM image (Downstream)**        | VM images built by the CI/CD pipeline through tools such as Packer, Azure Image Builder and GCP VM Image Builds. The VM image inherits the pipeline build context for deployment lineage tracking                                                                                                              |
| **Cloud resource (Downstream)**  | Cloud resources deployed by the CI/CD pipeline. The Code-to-Cloud graph traces the deployment lineage from the pipeline to the runtime cloud resource. The cloud resource inherits the pipeline deployment context                                                                                             |

**Filter and prioritize repositories**

The **CI/CD Pipelines** page displays a table of all CI/CD pipeline assets discovered through active CI/CD integrations. Apply filters to narrow results based on operational and security metadata.

To effectively reduce the organization CI/CD risk surface, apply the following filter combinations to prioritize remediation efforts:

* **Prioritize active deployment workflows**: Filter by **Last Job Execution column** (most recent first) to surface pipelines that are actively running. This ensures you are prioritizing remediation efforts on live, active workflows rather than dormant codebases
* **Scope by CI/CD provider:** Use the **CI/CD Provider** filter (or dashboard widget) to isolate the inventory by provider (for example, GitHub Actions or Jenkins) to evaluate provider-specific misconfigurations and enforce platform-level security standards

**Repository inventory table actions**

Right-click on a row in the inventory table to take the following actions:

* **Open in new tab**: Opens the description tab of the asset for detailed analysis of the issue
* **View asset data**: Opens a new pop-up window displaying the data retrieved for the asset during the most recent scan in either JSON (default) or tree view. This raw data provides a comprehensive and unformatted view of the asset's properties and attributes as they were initially ingested
* **Copy text to clipboard**: Copies the selected text to the clipboard
* **Copy entire row**: Copies the entire selected row data
* **Show/hide rows**: Stand on data in a row and filter the entire inventory to show or hide assets based on the selected attribute
* **Open in Cortex Assistant/Open in Cortex Agentic Assistant**: Opens the repository in Cortex Assistant or Cortex Agentic Assistant.
