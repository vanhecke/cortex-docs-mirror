# Repository assets

Cortex XSIAM discovers and inventories every repository connected through a Version Control System (VCS) integration; GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps. Each onboarded repository appears in the unified asset inventory as the source-of-truth for the software supply chain, carrying its identity metadata, ownership context, business criticality, security health, and downstream deployment lineage.

The repository asset enables security teams to answer three questions about every codebase: **What is it? Where does it sit in the organization? What is its security health?**

{% hint style="info" %}
### Note

Scope: The repository asset represents a VCS repository onboarded into Cortex XSIAM. The repository asset does not represent container image repositories, artifact registries, or cloud resource inventories; those asset categories are managed under the Compute and Cloud asset classes respectively.
{% endhint %}

The repository inventory provides the identity, context, and health telemetry needed to manage every codebase as a governed asset.

Core achievements and use cases

* **Asset discovery and identity:** Every repository connected through a VCS integration is automatically discovered and registered in the unified asset inventory with a unique asset identifier, VCS provider, organization, default branch, and onboarding timestamp to serve as the persistent identity record for the codebase
* **Asset metadata enrichment:** The repository asset is continuously enriched with metadata synchronized from the VCS provider. Retrieving repository asset details through the API enables synchronization with external asset management systems, CMDB platforms, and compliance reporting tools
* **Code to cloud lineage:** The repository asset is the origin node in the code to cloud graph, establishing a traceable lineage from source code through software packages, IaC resources, and CI/CD pipelines to deployed container images and cloud resources
* **Asset health monitoring:** The repository asset provides a continuous health profile by aggregating security signals from all scanner types
* **Coverage measurement:** The repository inventory quantifies the ratio of discovered repositories to actively scanned repositories, enabling AppSec managers to identify and close coverage gaps manually or programmatically
* **Compliance evidence:** SBOM export (CycloneDX) at the repository level provides auditable evidence of software composition

**Functional responsibilities**

The repository asset model facilitates a structured delegation between governance and operations:

* **AppSec managers (Governance):** Review the repository inventory to identify coverage gaps such as repositories without active scanners, repositories not assigned to applications, or repositories with stale scan data, and define scanner configurations to prioritize remediation
* **AppSec practitioners (Operations):** Onboard repositories through VCS integrations, configure scanner enablement per repository, trigger rescans, export SBOMs for compliance evidence, and remediate issues

**Repository assets inventory**

To view and manage repository assets, you must have at least one Version Control System (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps) integrated and active and at least one repository onboarded through the VCS integration and visible in the asset inventory.

To access repository assets, go to **Inventory**, select **All Assets** → **Code** → **Repositories**.

The repositories assets page includes a dashboard and an inventory table.

**Repository dashboard**

The dashboard includes two widgets.

* **Providers:** Displays connected version control providers (such as GitHub and GitLab) and the number of repositories found in each provider.
* **Privacy State:** Shows the distribution between public and private repositories and the amount of repositories in each category.

Selecting an item in either widget filters the table accordingly.

**Repository table**

The following table describes the default exposed properties of the repository asset table. Select **Menu Settings** to view additional properties.

**Filter and prioritize repositories**

The **Repositories** page displays a table of all repositories. Use the search bar to find repositories by name, or apply filters to narrow results based on operational and security metadata.

To effectively reduce the organization risk surface, apply the following filter combinations to prioritize remediation efforts:

* **Target critical assets:** Filter by **Business Application Names** to isolate repositories tied to essential services and prioritize their vulnerabilities for remediation
* **Identify public exposure risks:** Filter by **Repository visibility configuration: Public** to identify proprietary repositories inadvertently set to public in the VCS provider
* **Find active repositories missing scanner coverage:** Filter by **Is repository archived: No** and sort the table by the **Last Scan Date** column to highlight actively maintained repositories that have never been scanned
* **Filter out noise from stale code:** Filter by **Is repository archived: Yes** or sort by the oldest **Last Commit Date** to isolate abandoned or read-only codebases
* **Scope by business unit or environment:** Use the **repository tag metadata** filter to isolate the inventory for specific engineering teams or deployment environments

**Repository technologies**

You can add the **Repository technologies** column to the table through **Menu Settings**. Each technology appears as a **tag** containing the technology icon and name (for example, a JavaScript icon followed by **javascript**), If a repository contains multiple technologies, the column displays a truncated list showing the first three. Hover over the indicator to view the full list. The technology data is derived from the repository file composition and is updated with each repository scan.

You can also filter the repositories table by **Repository technologies** to look for assets that use a specific technology. The filter supports wildcard filtering and is case-insensitive. You can also view technologies in repository asset cards.Hover over a tag to view a tooltip showing the percentage of the codebase attributed to that technology. Percentages sum to 100%.

<details>

<summary>Repository technologies frequently asked questions</summary>

**Can users manually tag a repository with a custom or proprietary technology?**

No. Technology detection is fully automated and cannot be manually overridden or supplemented. The detection engine identifies technologies based on file analysis during repository scans. If a custom or proprietary framework is not detected, it does not appear in the Technologies property.

However, repository **Tags** (a separate feature from Technologies) can be used to manually label repositories with custom metadata. Repository tags are displayed in the **Tags** property of the repository side card and can be used for organizational purposes.

**What happens when a new language is added to a repository?**

The new technology is detected and displayed after the next repository scan. You can trigger an immediate update by selecting **Rescan** from the repository side card.

**Are technology percentages based on lines of code or file count?**

Technology percentages represent the proportional share of each technology in the repository codebase. The detection engine uses file-level analysis to calculate the proportions. The percentages across all detected technologies in a repository sum to 100%.

**Do technologies affect security scanning or policy evaluation?**

Technologies are informational metadata displayed in the Asset Inventory. They do not directly control which scanners run or which policies apply. However, technology information can inform scanner configuration and policy scoping decisions.

<summary>Troubleshooting technology detection</summary>

If a known technology is not showing up for a repository, consider the following causes and resolutions:

| Cause                                                    | Resolution                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The repository has not been scanned recently**         | Trigger a manual rescan from the repository side card. Select the repository row, then select Rescan from the side card actions       |
| **All scanners are disabled for the repository**         | Verify that at least one scanner is enabled. If all scanners are disabled, the Rescan action is unavailable                           |
| **The technology files are on an unscanned branch**      | Technology detection covers only the branches configured for scanning. Verify the branch is included in the scanning scope            |
| **The technology is not in the supported detection set** | The engine recognizes a broad set of standard technologies. Proprietary or highly custom frameworks may not be detected automatically |
