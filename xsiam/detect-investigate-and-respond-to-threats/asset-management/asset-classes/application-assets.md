# Application assets

The **Business Application** asset inventory provides visibility into all business applications and their interconnected assets generated throughout your software development lifecycle (SDLC), serving as a centralized repository for business application inventory management. Additionally, the interface details the risks detected in your business applications, allowing you to prioritize, manage, and mitigate potential threats based on business criticality.

Applications act as a single, holistic entity that encompasses their entire lifecycle, from custom code to open-source libraries and infrastructure configurations. By grouping these interconnected assets, you can prioritize, analyze, and mitigate threats based on actual business criticality.

**Defining business applications**

You can define and group assets into applications using two primary methods:

* **Application Criteria:** Automatically create and maintain applications in bulk by defining dynamic rules. You can base these criteria on **Cloud tags** (such as AWS tags grouping assets within a single provider), or **VCS entities** (automatically generating applications based on your code hierarchy, such as GitHub organizations or repositories).
* **Application Builder:** **Manually build an application** by selecting starting assets from either the **code side** (VCS repositories) or the **run side** (cloud providers, Kubernetes clusters, or VPCs). Cortex XSIAM automatically identifies and adds related assets based on their connections.

**Application inventory**

Navigate to **Inventory > All Assets > Application > Business Applications** to view your application inventory.

The application asset inventory includes a dashboard with a widget of all issues detected in the application by severity level and a table including a list of applications.

The following fields are exposed in the application inventory table. To add additional table properties, select **Menu settings** → **\[property]**.

| Field           | Description                                                                                                                   |

{% tab title="Topology" %}
The **Topology** tab visualizes your application's asset relationships across the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC). It maps interconnected assets including code repositories, pipelines, container images, and workloads, providing a comprehensive representation of the code-to-cloud journey. You can view the topology either as a visual representation or as an asset inventory by selecting the **Graph** or **Inventory** (default) tabs respectively.

{% hint style="info" %}
### Note

The topology graph is available only when all application components (code, pipeline, build and deploy), are configured.
{% endhint %}

**Topology graph**

The graph displays the application path to production, organized into four key SDLC sections:

* **CODE**: Displays source code repositories and VCS organizations, allowing you to understand code organization and repository structure:
  * Providers: GitHub, GitLab, Azure Repos, Bitbucket
  * Key relationships: Organizations contain repositories; repositories are forked from others
* **BUILD**: Displays CI/CD pipelines, visualizing build processes and pipeline dependencies:
  * Providers: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, Azure Pipelines, CircleCI
  * Key relationships: Repositories trigger pipelines; pipelines build container images
* **Deploy**: Displays container registries and image repositories, allowing you to track image lineage and registry organization:
  * Providers: Docker Hub, Google Artifact Registry (GAR), Amazon ECR, Azure ACR
  * Key relationships: Registries contain image repositories; pipelines build specific container images
* **Run**: Displays runtime architecture, including compute, storage, networking, and identity assets, allowing you to understand runtime architecture and resource dependencies
  * Assets: Kubernetes clusters/workloads, virtual machines, serverless functions, storage buckets, load balancers, and IAM policies
  * Providers: AWS, GCP, Azure
  * Key relationships: Images run on instances, workloads use service accounts, functions access storage buckets

**Navigating the graph**

Use the following controls to manage the view and investigate assets:

* **Node actions**: Click any asset node to view basic details. Select **View Details** in the popup to open the asset side-car for comprehensive information without leaving the topology view
* **Search and highlight**: Search for specific assets by name to highlight matching nodes and navigate directly to them in the graph
* **Group nodes**: Toggle this to organize assets into logical clusters (such as Container Images), simplifying complex graphs. Click a group to expand it
* **Layers**: Apply filters to view assets based on specific criteria, such as public internet exposure, related cases, or associated runtime events

**Filtering and layout options**

Customize the display to focus on relevant information:

* **Section filtering**: Toggle visibility for specific SDLC sections (CODE, BUILD, DEPLOY, RUN) to isolate parts of the lifecycle
* **Provider filtering**: Filter assets by cloud or VCS provider (such as Show only AWS or GitHub assets)
* **Layout options**: Choose a visualization style:
  * Hierarchical: Top-to-bottom flow (Code → Build → Deploy → Run).
  * Force-Directed: Physics-based layout.
  * Circular: Circular arrangement.

**Understanding relationships**

Edges connecting nodes represent specific interactions or dependencies, including:

* **CONTAINS**: Hierarchical containment (such as Org → Repo)
* **TRIGGERS**: Activation (such as Repo → Pipeline)
* **BUILDS**: Creation (such as Pipeline → Image)
* **RUNS ON**: Runtime execution (such as Image → Container Instance)
* **USES/ACCESSES**: Resource usage or data access

**Common workflows**

* **Investigate critical vulnerabilities**: Identify a critical CVE, locate the affected repository in the graph, and trace relationships forward to see if vulnerable versions are currently deployed as running instances
* **Track Code to Cloud misconfigurations**: Identify IaC issues (code) and trace them to deployed cloud resources to ensure fixes are applied at the source to prevent future misconfigured deployments
* **Audit secret exposure**: Locate repositories with privileged secrets and trace them to the DEPLOY or RUN sections to see if those secrets are active in production environments
* **Understand application architecture**: Filter for the RUN section to identify runtime components, then trace back to source repositories to document deployment paths for compliance.

**Topology inventory**

The **Inventory** table displays all assets associated with the business application. Selecting an asset opens its side card directly without having to navigate away to the dedicated asset inventory.

* **Asset details**: Displays properties such as Name, Provider, Type, Region, and timestamps for First/Last Observed
* **Risk context**: Includes breakdowns of associated cases, critical issues, and vulnerability severity
