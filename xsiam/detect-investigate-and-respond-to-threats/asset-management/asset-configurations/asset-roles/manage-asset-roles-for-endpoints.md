# Manage Asset Roles for Endpoints

{% hint style="info" %}
### Note

The Identity Security Module add-on is required in order have the ability to explicitly edit the host lists assigned to asset roles.
{% endhint %}

You may want to exclude some endpoints from certain roles even if Cortex XSIAM automatically detected the endpoint as having this asset role. For example, if an endpoint is reassigned to another user and you want their Analytics behavioral baselines to be adjusted accordingly.

To access the management page, navigate to **Inventory** → **Assets** → **Configurations** → **Asset Roles**, right-click an endpoint asset role, and select **Edit Asset Role**. The Endpoints list on the page displays the endpoints classified under the asset role, whether the asset role was assigned automatically or edited manually for the endpoint, the last modification date, and the modifier.

When editing an asset role, there are two primary lists:

* **Included Endpoints:** Displays all the endpoints Cortex XSIAM automatically detects as having this asset role, as well as any endpoints you have manually added.
* **Excluded Endpoints:** Displays the endpoints that were manually removed from the asset role.

**Endpoint role actions**

* **Exclude an Endpoint:** If you want to remove an endpoint from an asset role, right-click the endpoint in the included list and select **Exclude Endpoint**. When you exclude an endpoint, it moves to the **Excluded Endpoints** list. This ensures that even if the endpoint exhibits behavior matching this role in the future, the automatic detection is overridden and the endpoint remains excluded. By default, excluding an endpoint also removes it from any parent asset roles.
* **Advanced Exclusion Settings:** To remove an endpoint from a child asset role but leave it in its parent asset roles, click **Advanced Exclusion Settings** and select **Don't Exclude** next to the name of the parent role.
* **Manually Add an Endpoint:** Click **Add Endpoint** to manually assign a role to a host. You can select the endpoint from a displayed list of hosts managed by your tenant. Note that you can only manually add endpoints that have the Cortex XSIAM agent installed on them. Manually added endpoints are analyzed by the Analytics engine on its next run and appear in the **Host Risk View** and **User Risk View**.
* **Delete vs. Exclude:** If you right-click and select **Delete Endpoint** on a manually added endpoint, it is removed from the included list. If the system automatically detects it acting in that role in the future, it is added back. If you want to prevent it from ever being added back, you must **Exclude** it instead.
* **Rename an Endpoint:** To change the name of an endpoint, right-click the endpoint name and select **Edit Endpoint**.
