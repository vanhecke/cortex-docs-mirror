# How to build XQL queries

The Cortex Query Language (XQL) enables you to query data ingested into Cortex XSIAM for rigorous endpoint and network event analysis. To help you create an eﬀective XQL query with the proper syntax, the query ﬁeld in the user interface provides suggestions and deﬁnitions as you type.

XQL forms queries in stages. Each stage performs a specific query operation and is separated by a pipe character (|). Queries require a dataset, or data source, to run against. You can either query the Cortex Data Model (XDM) or you can query specific datasets. In a dataset query, unless otherwise specified, the query runs against the **`xdr_data`** dataset, which contains all log information that Cortex XSIAM collects from all Cortex product agents, including EDR data, and PAN NGFW data. In XDM queries, you must specify the dataset mapped to the XDM that you want to run your query against.

Forensic datasets are not included by default in XQL query results, unless the dataset query is explicitly defined to use a forensic dataset.

<summary>Which datasets are mapped to XDM?</summary>

The Cortex Query Language (XQL) supports a single Cortex Data Model (XDM), which is a normalized data structure. Datasets are mapped to the XDM in 3 different ways:

1. Automatic default mappings, including the following:
   * The **`xdr_data`** dataset is automatically mapped to the XDM with some data mapping exceptions.
   * Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) network log data are mapped to the XDM from the following datasets:
     * `panw_ngfw_traffic_raw`
     * `panw_ngfw_threat_raw`
     * `panw_ngfw_url_raw`
     * `panw_ngfw_filedata_raw`
     * `panw_ngfw_globalprotect_raw`
     * `panw_ngfw_hipmatch_raw`
2. Out-of-the-box mappings of the datasets as part of the Data Model Rules via the Marketplace. For more information, see [Marketplace](../../../configure-cortex-xsiam/marketplace).
3. You can create your own mappings by creating your own Data Model Rules.

For more information on the XDM Schema, specifically the fields, fieldsets, fields designated as ENUMS (CONST), and aliases, see the [XSIAM Data Model Schema](https://app.gitbook.com/s/HVBaxKOW1b6qcIQ6iMBh/).

<summary>XDM query syntax</summary>

The basic syntax structure for querying the Cortex Data Model (XDM) is either:

```programlisting
datamodel dataset in (<dataset_name>,...) …
    | <STAGE> ...
    | <STAGE> ...
    | <STAGE> ...
```

or

```programlisting
datamodel dataset = <dataset_name> …
    | <STAGE> ...
    | <STAGE> ...
    | <STAGE> ...
```

In a query using the **`datamodel`** command, a query runs against the specified datasets, which contain log information ingested by Cortex XSIAM. You can also install Marketplace Content Packs, or map an ingested dataset into the XDM, to query additional datasets.

Adding a wildcard suffix (\*) is supported in the **`<dataset_name>`**, which matches all datasets that are mapped to the data model and begin with the specified text. For example, **`datamodel dataset = xdr*`** or **`datamodel dataset in (xdr*)`**.

When querying the XDM, fields that are not mapped to the XDM are accessible by **`<dataset>.<field>`**. They can be used at any stage of a **`datamodel`** query.

When creating XDM queries, auto-suggestions are available, according to the existing XDM fields.

<summary>Dataset query syntax</summary>

In a dataset query, unless otherwise specified, the query runs against the `xdr_data` dataset, which contains all log information that Cortex XSIAM collects from all Cortex product agents, including EDR data, and PAN NGFW data. In a dataset query, if you are running your query against a dataset that has been set as default, there is no need to specify a dataset. Otherwise, specify a dataset in your query. The Dataset Queries lists the available datasets, depending on system configuration.

{% hint style="info" %}
* Users with different dataset permissions can receive different results for the same XQL query.
* An administrator or a user with a predefined user role can create and view queries built with an unknown dataset that currently does not exist in Cortex XSIAM. All other users can only create and view queries built with an existing dataset.
* When you have more than one dataset or lookup, you can change your default dataset by navigating to **Settings** → **Configurations** → **Data Management** → **Dataset Management**, right-click on the appropriate dataset, and select **Set as default**.
{% endhint %}

The basic syntax structure for querying datasets that are not mapped to the XDM is:

```programlisting
dataset = <dataset name> 
    | <stage1> ...
    | <stage2> ... 
    | <stage3> ...
```

or

```programlisting
dataset in (<dataset name>)
    | <stage1> ...
    | <stage2> ...
    | <stage3> ...
```

You can specify a dataset using one of the following formats, which is based on the data retention offerings available in Cortex XSIAM.

*   Hot Storage queries use the format `dataset = <dataset name>`. This is the default option.

    ```programlisting
    dataset = xdr_data
    ```
*   Cold Storage queries use the format `cold_dataset = <dataset name>`.

    ```programlisting
    cold_dataset = xdr_data
    ```

    <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="info" class="hint hint-info"><p>You can build a query that investigates data in both a cold dataset and a hot dataset in the same query. In addition, as the hot storage dataset format is the default option and represents the fully searchable storage, this format is used throughout this guide for investigation and threat hunting.</p></div>

When using the hot storage default format, this returns every `xdr_data` record contained in your Cortex XSIAM instance over the time range that you provide to the Query Builder user interface. This can be a large amount of data, which may take a long time to retrieve. You can use a `limit` stage to specify how many records you want to retrieve.

There is no practical limit to the number of stages that you can specify.

In the `xdr_data` dataset, every user ﬁeld included in the raw data for network, authentication, and login events has an equivalent normalized user ﬁeld associated with it that displays the user information in the following standardized format:

`<company domain>\<username>`

For example, the `login_data` ﬁeld has the `login_data_dst_normalized_user` ﬁeld to display the content in the standardized format. To ensure the most accurate results, we recommend that you use these `normalized_user` ﬁelds when building your queries.

<summary>Additional components</summary>

XQL queries can contain different components, such as functions and stages, depending on the type of query you want to build.
