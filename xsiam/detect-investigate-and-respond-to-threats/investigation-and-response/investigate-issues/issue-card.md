# Issue card

The Issue card provides a full breakdown of an issue, helping you understand the root cause and take action through relevant evidence, remediation guidance, and response options.

The issue card supports full case investigation by retaining case context. Once you have finished reviewing an issue, close the card to return to the initial case investigation.

Each issue card adapts to the type of issue you’re investigating, surfacing the most relevant information and tools at every stage of the workflow. While layouts may vary, most issues share a common set of tabs designed to support triage, investigation, and resolution.

### Overview

* Assignee

* Suggested automations to run on the issue. Click the automation to open to the Work Plan tab with details of the automation.

    Click the expand icon to see a list of all standards associated with the issue and a granular breakdown of specific controls breached under each standard.
* If an automation rule triggered an automation (Quick Action, playbook, or agentic agent) to run on the issue, the name of the last automation to run on the issue is displayed.
* (For issues related to Container images) **Related Affected Assets** displays the assets that are related to the assets listed under **Affected Assets**. For example, if one of the associated assets is a container image running on a VM, the VM will be listed under this section.

The Evidence section contains information to help you investigate the issue, such as the causality chain.

### Issue Information

Displays a summary of the issue, such as issue details , indicators, and outstanding tasks. Some fields are informational and some can be edited. Includes the following sections (depending on the layout):

* **Issue details**: A summary of the issue, such as type, severity, and when the issue occurred. You can update these fields as required.
* **Command and task results**: Lists any manual commands and playbook task results.
* **Work plan**: View or take action on the following:
  * **Playbook tasks**: When a playbook runs, any outstanding tasks appear. You can take various actions here or in the Work Plan tab.
  * **To-Do Tasks**: An ad-hoc item that is not attached to the Work Plan. Create tasks for users to complete as part of an investigation. These are like a To-Do list that you keep in an investigation on an ad-hoc basis, rather than the Work Plan, which follows a pre-defined process. You can view or create To-Do tasks.
* **Notes:** Helps you understand specific actions taken, and allows you to view conversations between analysts to see how they arrived at a certain decision. You can see the thought process behind identifying key evidence and identifying similar cases.
* **Malicious or suspicious indicators:** A list of any malicious or suspicious indicators. If you have the Threat Intel add-on, you can pivot to the Indicators page, where you can take further action on the indicator.
* **Indicator handling:** Take actions on indicators from the displayed options.
