# Detailed View

The **Detailed View** in the case card provides a table-based format and custom layouts, ensuring full backward compatibility. You can switch between the **Overview** and the **Detailed View** based on your workflow preferences in Cortex XSIAM.

The **Detailed View** supports deep inspection and manual analysis while maintaining access to the same underlying case data. It includes the following tabs:

<table><thead><tr><th width="163">Tab</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Issues &#x26; Insights</td><td>Displays a list of issues and insights linked to the case. Click on an issue or insight to open the issue card.</td></tr><tr><td>Key Assets &#x26; Artifacts</td><td>Displays asset and artifact information of the key artifacts, hosts, and users associated with the case. Hover over an icon for more information, or click the more options icon to see the available views and actions. For more information about investigating key assets and artifacts, see <a href="../../investigate-artifacts-and-assets">Investigate artifacts and assets</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Timeline</td><td><p>Displays a chronological representation of issues and actions relating to the case. Each timeline entry represents a type of action that was triggered in the issue.</p><p>Issues that include the same artifacts are grouped into one timeline entry and display the common artifact in an interactive link. Click on an entry to view additional details in the Details pane. You can also filter the timeline by action type. Depending on the type of action, you can select the entry to further investigate and take action on it.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Case War Room</td><td><p>The Case War Room is a collection of the Active Response investigation actions, artifacts, and collaboration pieces for an issue or case. It is a chronological journal of the case investigation. You can run commands and playbooks from the War Room and filter the entries for easier viewing.</p><p>The War Room facilitates real-time investigation. Powered by ChatOps, the War Room helps you perform different tasks related to their case investigation using CLI commands. For example, running real-time security actions through the CLI, without switching consoles, and running security playbooks, scripts, and commands. For more information, see <a href="../../investigate-issues/use-the-war-room-in-an-investigation">Use the War Room in an investigation</a>.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Executions</td><td>Displays the causality chains associated with the case. On this tab, you can investigate a causality chain and take actions on a host. For more information, see <a href="../../investigate-issues/causality-view">Causality view</a>.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<summary>Investigate key assets and artifacts</summary>

The **Key Assets & Artifacts** tab displays all the case assets and artifact information of hosts, users, and key artifacts associated with the case.

1.  Investigate artifacts.

    In the **Artifacts** section, review the artifacts associated with the case. Each artifact displays, if available, the artifact information and available actions according to the type of artifact: File, IP Address, and Domain.
2.  Investigate hosts.

    In the **Hosts** section, review the hosts associated with the case. Each host displays, if available, host information and available actions.

    To further investigate the host, select the host name to display the Details panel. The panel is only available for hosts with the agent installed and displays the host name, whether it’s connected, along with the **Endpoint Details**, **Agent Details**, **Network**, and **Policy information** details. If the Details panel is not available, click the more options icon next to a host name to see the available options.
3.  Investigate users.

    In the **Users** section, review the users associated with the case. Each user displays, if available, the user information and available actions

<summary>Investigate the case timeline</summary>

The **Timeline** tab is a chronological representation of issues and actions relating to the case.

1. Navigate to the **Timeline** tab and filter the actions according to the action type.
2.  Investigate a timeline entry.

    Each timeline entry is a representation of a type of action that was triggered in the issue. Issues that include the same artifacts are grouped into one timeline entry and display the common artifact in an interactive link. Depending on the type of action, you can select the entry, host names, and artifacts to further investigate the action:

    * Locate the action you want to investigate:
      * For **Quick Actions** and **Case Management Actions**, you can add and view comments relating to the action.
      * For **Issues**, **Automatic Case Updates** and **Automation** actions, click the action to open the Details panel. In the panel, go to the **Issues** tab to view the issues table filtered by issues ID, the **Key Assets** to view a list of **Hosts** and **Users** associated to the issue, and an option to add **Comments**.
