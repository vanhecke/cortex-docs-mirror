# AI-generated case summaries

To gain immediate situational awareness, Cortex XSIAM automatically builds a narrative of the case using **AI-generated titles and descriptions**. This summarized context allows you to quickly grasp the scope of a case and provides a clear starting point for your investigation.

Leveraging LLM-based summarization, the system analyzes complex data to produce a human-readable overview of:

* The nature of the threat or activity
* The key issues and artifacts involved
* The affected assets or identities

### View the AI-generated case summary

When you open a case, the case title and summary is automatically generated. As an investigation evolves, the case context is updated. Each time new data or issues are added, the system regenerates the title and description to ensure your situational awareness reflects the most current information available.

{% hint style="info" %}
### Note

The AI-generated title and description is a calculated value that is regenerated each time you open a case.

This value is not a saved static description, therefore it is not reflected in the saved case names in the list of cases in the **Split view** , or in the **Case Name** and **Case Description** columns in the **Table view**.
{% endhint %}

### System-generated case titles and descriptions

In addition to the AI-generated case titles and summaries, Cortex XSIAM automatically generates static case titles and descriptions that are stored in the cases dataset. These are generated at the time of case creation based on correlated issues, behaviors, and contextual data.

These static descriptions are used when AI-generated case summaries are unavailable or disabled. In addition, they are reflected in the case title in the List of cases in the **Split view**, and the **Case Name** and **Case Description** columns in the **Table view.**

You can manually update these values.

### Single issue cases

For cases that contain a single issue, the case title and description directly reflect the issue’s title and description. In addition, AI-generated case summaries are not available. If more issues are linked to the case, Cortex XSIAM generates a case title and description to reflect the issues in the case, and an AI case title and summary is available.

### Limitations

* **Supported regions:** AI-generated case titles and summaries are available only in supported regions. For more information, see Cortex Agentic Assistant.
* **Supported domains:** AI-generated case titles and summaries are only supported for cases assigned to the **Security** and **Posture** domains.
* **Single-issue cases:** For cases that contain a single issue, AI-generated case summaries are not available. Instead, the case title and description directly reflect the issue’s title and description. If more issues are linked to the case, an AI case title and summary are generated.

### Enable AI summarization

To enable AI case summarization on your tenant, go to Configurations → **General** → **Server Settings** → **AI Configuration** and enable the following settings:

* **Agents & LLM Experience**
* **AI Case Summarization**

You can also turn AI summarization on or off for a specific case. Take the following steps:

1. Open the case and click the **Actions** menu.
2. Select **Edit case details**.
3. Switch the **Summarize with AI** toggle.
