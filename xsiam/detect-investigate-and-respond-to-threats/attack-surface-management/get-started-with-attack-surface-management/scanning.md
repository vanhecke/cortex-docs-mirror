# Scanning

Attack Surface Management (ASM) in Cortex XSIAM uses data collected from global internet scans as well open-source intelligence about the internet to maintain a complete inventory of all the internet-facing assets that belong to an organization. The following topics describe the scans that Cortex XSIAM uses to map and monitor your attack surface.

## **Scanning cadences**

Cortex XSIAM scans the internet to discover new services at varying cadences depending on several factors such as port, protocol, cloud provider ranges, and customer-attributed assets. All responsive services are monitored regularly.

Below is a list of our targeted scanning cadences:

* **Discovery Scans**
  * **Global Base**— twice per week discovery of approximately 250 of the most common ports on all IPv4 space.
  * **Global Extended**—low background rate discovery of the remaining 65k ports, excluding those covered in KAM base and KAM extended.
  * **KAM (Known Assets Monitoring) Base**—daily discovery of approximately 300 of the most common ports on customer-attributed assets.
  * **KAM Extended**—weekly discovery of approximately 2800 of the most common ports on customer-attributed assets. These do not overlap with KAM Base.
* **Monitoring Scans**
  * Daily on all responsive services.
* **Attack Surface Testing Scans**
  * Daily on configured services.

## **Known Assets Monitoring**

Cortex XSIAM performs global scans twice a week on a limited set of ports by default. For customers who opt in, Cortex XSIAMperforms targeted scanning of known assets daily. Known Assets Monitoring (KAM) brings three significant benefits to the data delivered by Cortex XSIAM:

* Additional ports and protocols
  * Port/protocol pairs not included in global scans, including port 25/SMTP, 500/UDP
  * SMB version enumeration
* TLS/SSL scanning
  * Determination of supported cipher suites and protocol versions for TLS/SSL services
* Frequent scanning and data delivery
  * Faster data delivery for reduced time to notification of new exposures

### **Opting in to Known Assets Monitoring**

Note the following prerequisites for Known Assets Monitoring (KAM):

* KAM uses more exhaustive payloads than global scans, so we recommend validating your network before opting in. KAM will be turned on once we have consent from the network owner that all identified ranges have been validated.
* We recommend verifying that KAM source IP addresses are not blocked on your automated intrusion prevention system (IPS), intrusion detection system (IDS), or firewalls and that anti-scanning and DDoS rules do not apply to these specific IP ranges.
  * Cortex XSIAM scans your external attack surface only, so we do not need any access inside your network.
  * The amount of traffic you receive from our scanners depends on the KAM configuration (basic or extended) and the total amount of IP space owned by your organization.
* Contact your Customer Success Team to learn more and opt in to KAM.

## **Scanning ports and protocols**

Cortex XSIAM detects protocol-validated services on the IPv4 and IPv6 space of the internet through a series of specialized payloads that target specific port-protocol pairs. Following are examples of some of the protocols and ports on which Cortex XSIAM checks for active services throughout a standard global scan.

## **Scanning activity**

Cortex Xpanse at Palo Alto Networks takes an outside-in approach to network security and asset management. We continuously scan the global internet to monitor our customers' internet-facing attack surface and discover emerging threats.

Our scanning activity on the ranges below is CFAA-compliant. You can mark our ranges as non-malicious in your system so that you stop getting alerts, or configure your firewall to drop traffic from our ranges.
