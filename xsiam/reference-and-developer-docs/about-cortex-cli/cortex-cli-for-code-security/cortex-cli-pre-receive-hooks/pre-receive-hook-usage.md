description: Run Cortex CLI pre-receive hooks for code security checks in Cortex XSIAM.

# Pre-receive hook usage

The hook executes a script on every git push.

By default, Cortex CLI pre-receive hooks:

* **Only scans code changes**: It analyzes the code difference included in the pushed commits, not the entire repository
* **Scans for secrets only**: The analysis is focused on detecting sensitive information
* **Does not upload results to Cortex Cloud**: All scan results are kept local to your machine (on the server)

## Understanding the script variables

* `CORTEX_CLI`: Defines the executable path, pointing to the absolute location of the `cortexcli` binary
* `BASE_COMMAND`: Assembles the core command string, including authentication flags (`--api-base-url`, `--api-key-id`, `--api-key`) and the primary command: `code pre-receive`. The use of `${...}` ensures authentication variables are injected as flag values
* `OPTIONAL_FLAGS`: An empty variable placeholder for adding optional runtime arguments

## Command flag reference

Use the following flags with the pre-receive command to customize scanner behavior.

**Example command structure:**

```programlisting
$ cortexcli code pre-receive [options]
```

| Command                     | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--ignore-existing-secrets` | Ignores secrets that already exist in the periodic scan (default: false) `[$CORTEX_CODE_IGNORE_EXISTING_SECRETS]`                                                 |
| `--validate-secrets`        | Checks if the secrets are valid (default: false) `[$CORTEX_CODE_VALIDATE_SECRETS]`                                                                                |
| `--skip-path`               | Specifies a file or directory path to skip during the scan `[$CORTEX_CODE_SKIP_PATH]`                                                                             |
| `--compact`                 | Prevents the display of code blocks in the output (default: false) `[$CORTEX_CODE_COMPACT]`                                                                       |
| `--summary-position`        | Determines whether the summary appears on top (before the check results) or on bottom (after the check results). (default: top) `[$CORTEX_CODE_SUMMARY_POSITION]` |
| `--no-fail-on-crash`        | Returns exit code `0` instead of `2` in case of a failure in the integration with the platform (default: false) `[$CORTEX_CODE_NO_FAIL_ON_CRASH]`                 |
| `--help, -h`                | Displays a help message with available options                                                                                                                    |

## Breakglass: Bypassing the hook

The breakglass feature allows you to intentionally bypass the pre-receive hook security scan. This is useful in urgent situations where a push must go through immediately, but it should be used with caution as it overrides your security policies.

1.  Configure your server to accept custom push options:

    ````programlisting
    ```bash
    git config receive.advertisePushOptions true
    ```
    ````
2.  Add the `-o breakglass` option to your `git push` command:

    ````programlisting
    ```bash
    git push -o breakglass
    ```
    ````

## Troubleshooting and recommendations

* Refer to the [Cortex CLI](../..) for more information on the Cortex CLI.
* Modify the script as required based on the server running the VCS
* The Cortex CLI must be available on the server. This documentation does not describe the CLI installation process
* Update the Cortex CLI periodically
*   Instead of adding the API URL and credentials directly in the script, consider creating a `~/.cortexcli/.cortex.yaml` configuration file (owned by the git user and group) with the following contents:

    ```programlisting
    CORTEX_API_BASE_URL: <api base url>
    CORTEX_API_KEY: <api key>
    CORTEX_API_KEY_ID: <api key id>
    ```
