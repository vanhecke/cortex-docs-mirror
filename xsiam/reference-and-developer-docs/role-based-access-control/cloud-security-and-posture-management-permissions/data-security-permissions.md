# Data Security permissions

The Data Security permission includes the following permissions:

* Endpoint DLP: Includes permissions such as Data-in-motion rules and Endpoint Applications.
* Data Security: Data Security Posture Management (DSPM)

This section controls access to the DSPM features, which provide deep visibility into cloud data assets (such as storage buckets, databases, and backups) and their underlying data objects (files, columns, and tables). It also controls access to the Data Pattern Inventory, Data Security Detection Rules, and the Data Security Issues queue.

Users access DSPM from Modules → Data Security.

Requires Cloud Posture Security, Cloud Runtime Security, or Cortex XSIAM Premium license.

Required and recommended permissions

To effectively secure cloud data and investigate complex data-centric threats, administrators and analysts require deep visibility into the underlying cloud configurations and standard investigation tools. Consider adding the following permissions:

| Permission      | Permission Level | Reason                                                                                                                 |
