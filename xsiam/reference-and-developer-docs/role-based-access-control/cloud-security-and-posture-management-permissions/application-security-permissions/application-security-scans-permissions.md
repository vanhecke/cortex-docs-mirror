# Application Security - Scans permissions

Configure the following permission for Application Security Scans:

* [Periodic scans](#periodic-scans)
* [PR scans](#pr-scans)
* [CI/CD scans](#cicd-scans)

Requires the Application Security add-on, in addition to a foundational Cloud Posture Security, Cloud Runtime Security, or Cortex XSIAM Premium license.

### Periodic scans

Branch Periodic Scans are scheduled, automated scans of repository branches. They run on a configurable schedule to continuously monitor the security posture of your codebase. Results show findings per branch, including IaC misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, secrets, and other issue types. To access Branch Periodic scans, go to Modules → Application Security → Scans → Branch Periodic Scans.

### PR scans

Pull Request Scans are event-driven scans triggered on PR creation or update. They provide inline security feedback to developers during the code review process, enabling shift-left security. Results are tied to specific pull requests and show new findings introduced by the PR. To access PR scans, go to Modules → Application Security → Scans → Pull Request Scans.

### CI/CD scans

CI/CD Scans are scans integrated into CI/CD pipelines that run during pipeline execution. They provide security gates within the build and deployment process, enabling automated security checks before code reaches production. Results are tied to specific pipeline runs. To access CI/CD scans, go to Modules → Application Security → Scans → CI Scans.
