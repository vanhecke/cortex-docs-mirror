| Agent Groups          | View             | Required for policy assignment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Agent Administrations | View             | Strongly recommended. View endpoints to validate policy deployment and verify protection status after changes.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Global Exceptions     | View             | Strongly recommended. Exceptions modify policy behavior. Understanding active exceptions is essential for accurate policy assessment. View/Edit. Required. Policy changes often require corresponding exception updates. Without exception access, policy tuning is incomplete. |
| Host Insights         | View             | Recommended for viewing policy effectiveness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Agent Profiles        | View             | Strongly recommended. Prevention profiles define the detailed security settings within policies. Understanding profiles is essential for effective policy design.                                                                                                               |
| Cases & Issues        | View             | Recommended. Review security events to inform policy tuning decisions. Understanding what threats are being detected helps optimize policies.                                                                                                                                   |
