# Query Center permissions

Controls access to the Query Center (under **Investigation & Response** → **Search**), which is the primary interface for writing, executing, and managing XQL queries in Cortex XSIAM. It is the core investigation tool that enables security analysts to search across all ingested data using a powerful query language. Key capabilities:

* Write and execute XQL queries against any ingested dataset.
* View query execution history and results.
* Schedule recurring queries
* Export query results

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Caution

Access to the Query Center is strictly governed by Scope-Based Access Control (SBAC). Even if users have View/Edit permissions, they will only see data returned from the endpoint groups or log sources defined in their specific role scope.

| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| None       | The entire Investigation section is hidden: Query Center, Query Builder, and Scheduled Queries are all inaccessible.                                                                |                                                                 |
| View       | Read-only access to the Query Center. Users can view query history, view scheduled queries, view active queries, and view individual execution results, but cannot run new queries. | Most viewer-type roles.                                         |
| View/Edit  | Full read and write access, including scheduling, canceling, running queries, deleting execution data, and deleting executions.                                                     | Most roles require query execution, scheduling, and management. |

**Required and recommended permissions**

To make the most of the Query Center capabilities, consider adding the following permissions:

| Permission     | Permission Level                 | Reason                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Dashboards     | Enabled                          | Strongly recommended for the analyst to take an XQL query and **Save to Dashboard** to create a visual monitoring widget.                                                |
| Reports        | View/Edit                        | Recommended if the analyst needs to turn a search result into a scheduled PDF report for management.                                                                     |
| Query Library  | Enabled with checkboxes selected | Recommended to view saved queries.                                                                                                                                       |
| Dataset Access | N/a                              | Ensure the role's Data Scope includes the necessary pro-datasets (e.g., Cloud, Network, Endpoint) or the user will receive "No Results Found" even with a perfect query. |
