# Data-in-Motion Rules

Data-in-motion Rules define the DLP policies that govern how sensitive data is handled when it moves across endpoints. These rules specify what data patterns to detect, which applications and destinations to monitor, and what actions to take (allow, block, notify) when sensitive data movement is detected. Rules can be created, edited, cloned, enabled/disabled, deleted, and prioritized.

Users access Data In Motion Rules by going to **Modules** → **Data Security** → **Endpoint Data-in-Motion Rules**.

They can view rule names, priorities, statuses (enabled/disabled), target applications, conditions, actions, and inspect rule details. | <ul><li>SOC Tier 2 and 3 Analysts: May need to review DLP rules when investigating cases/issues,</li><li>Threat Hunter: May need to understand DLP rules to correlate with threat hunting findings</li></ul> |

**Required and recommended permissions**

Data-in-Motion rules act as the enforcement arm of your DLP strategy. To build effective rules, administrators must have visibility into the sensitive data profiles they are detecting and the applications they are monitoring.

| Endpoint DLP Settings            | View             | Strongly recommended. Global DLP settings (such as the default action, domain names, and browser extensions) directly affect rule behavior and enforcement.                                                     |
| Endpoint Applications and Groups | View             | Strongly recommended. DLP rules directly reference specific endpoint applications and application groups to define their scope. Viewing these catalogs is essential to understand and configure rule targeting. |
| Agent Administrations            | View             | Strongly recommended. Understand which endpoints have the XDR agent deployed.                                                                                                                                   |
| Data Classification              | View             | Strongly Recommended. DLP rules directly reference the data profiles configured within the Data Classification module. Understanding these profiles is required to know what the rule considers sensitive data. |
