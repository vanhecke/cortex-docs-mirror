# Layout permissions

Controls access within Object Setup (**Settings** → **Configurations** → **Object Setup**) to the following:

* Case layouts (**Cases** → **Layouts**): Visual layout definitions that determine how case data is presented when viewing a case. Layouts define which fields are shown, their arrangement in sections/tabs:
* Case layout rules (**Cases** → **Layout Rules**): Rules that determine which layout is applied to a given case based on conditions (e.g., case type, source, severity).
* Issue layouts (**Issues** → **Layouts**): Visual layout definitions that determine how alert data is presented when viewing an issue. Layouts define which fields are shown, their arrangement in sections/tabs, and widget configurations.
* Issue layout rules (**Issues** → **Layout Rules**): Rules that determine which layout is applied to a given issue based on conditions (e.g., issue type, source, severity).
