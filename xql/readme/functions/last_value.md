# last\_value

Use the `last_*value()` function within the `windowcomp` stage to retrieve the value of a specified field from the last row within a defined window or partition. This function is useful when you need to access the most recent or final value of a sequence relative to the current row being processed.

## Syntax

```sql
windowcomp last_value(\<field\>) [by \<field\> [,\<field\>,...]] sort [asc|desc] \<field1\> [, [asc|desc] \<field2\>,...] [between 0|null|\<number\>|-\<number\> [and 0|null|\<number\>|-\<number\>] [frame_type=range]] [as \<alias\>]  
```

## Parameters

| Name           | Type               | Required | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| field          | Any supported type | Yes      | The field from which to retrieve the value.                                                                                                               |
| by field       | string             | No       | Partitions the data into distinct groups. The last\_value() function operates independently within each of these partitions.                              |
| sort field     | string             | Yes      | Defines the order of rows within each partition. This order is crucial for correctly identifying the "last" row for the last\_value() calculation.        |
| between clause | string             | No       | Defines a "window frame" (a specific range of rows) relative to the current row. If omitted, the default window (typically the entire partition) is used. |
| alias          | string             | No       | Assigns an alias name to the new column displaying the result.                                                                                            |

## Returns

The last\_value() function returns a single value that corresponds to the field's value in the last row within the defined window frame. This value is then returned for every row in that window, and its data type matches the data type of the input field.

## Usage Notes

* last\_value() is a navigation function and must be used with the windowcomp stage.
* The sort clause is mandatory because it defines the logical order of rows, determining which row is considered the "last" one.
* If you use the `by` clause to partition the data, the function restarts its calculation for each new partition.
* If the `between` clause is omitted, the default window frame typically covers the entire partition, meaning the "last" row is the last row of the partition.

## Examples

### Example 1: last\_value() over an entire partition (default window)

**Goal**: Retrieve the duration\_seconds from the last event within each is\_successful group, ordered by \_time, and replicate this value for every row in that group.

**XQL Code**:

```sql

config timeframe = 1d
| dataset = sample_xql_raw
| fields event_id, _time, is_successful, duration_seconds
| windowcomp last_value(duration_seconds) by is_successful sort asc _time as last_duration_in_partition
| sort asc is_successful, asc _time, asc event_id
| limit 10
```

**Explanation**: You partition the data by is\_successful and sort it by \_time ascending. For the false partition, the chronologically last event is 109 with duration\_seconds = 0.05. For the true partition, the last event is 110 with duration\_seconds = 60.0. These last values are assigned to all rows within their respective partitions.

**Output**:

| \_time                  | event\_id | is\_successful | duration\_seconds | last\_duration\_in\_partition |
| ----------------------- | --------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 2023-10-26 10:05:30 UTC | 102       | false          | 0.8               | 0.05                          |
| 2023-10-26 10:40:10 UTC | 106       | false          | 2.1               | 0.05                          |
| 2023-10-26 10:55:55 UTC | 109       | false          | 0.05              | 0.05                          |
| 2023-10-26 10:00:00 UTC | 101       | true           | 1.5               | 60.0                          |
| 2023-10-26 10:15:15 UTC | 103       | true           | 10.2              | 60.0                          |
| 2023-10-26 10:20:00 UTC | 104       | true           | 0.1               | 60.0                          |
| 2023-10-26 10:30:45 UTC | 105       | true           | 5.0               | 60.0                          |
| 2023-10-26 10:45:00 UTC | 107       | true           | 7.8               | 60.0                          |
| 2023-10-26 10:50:20 UTC | 108       | true           | 15.3              | 60.0                          |
| 2023-10-26 11:00:10 UTC | 110       | true           | 60.0              | 60.0                          |

### Example 2: last\_value() with a rolling window

**Goal**: Retrieve the duration\_seconds from the last event within a sliding window consisting of the current row and the two preceding rows.

**XQL Code**:

```sql

config timeframe = 1d
| dataset = sample_xql_raw
| fields event_id, _time, is_successful, duration_seconds
| windowcomp last_value(duration_seconds) by is_successful sort asc _time between -2 and 0 as rolling_last_value
| sort asc is_successful, asc _time, asc event_id
| limit 10
```

\*\* Explanation\*\* : You define a window of between -2 and 0 (the two preceding rows up to the current row). Because the current row is always the "last" element of this specific sliding window, the function simply returns the duration\_seconds of the current row itself.

**Output**:

| \_time                  | event\_id | is\_successful | duration\_seconds | rolling\_last\_value |
| ----------------------- | --------- | -------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| 2023-10-26 10:05:30 UTC | 102       | false          | 0.8               | 0.8                  |
| 2023-10-26 10:40:10 UTC | 106       | false          | 2.1               | 2.1                  |
| 2023-10-26 10:55:55 UTC | 109       | false          | 0.05              | 0.05                 |
| 2023-10-26 10:00:00 UTC | 101       | true           | 1.5               | 1.5                  |
| 2023-10-26 10:15:15 UTC | 103       | true           | 10.2              | 10.2                 |
| 2023-10-26 10:20:00 UTC | 104       | true           | 0.1               | 0.1                  |
| 2023-10-26 10:30:45 UTC | 105       | true           | 5.0               | 5.0                  |
| 2023-10-26 10:45:00 UTC | 107       | true           | 7.8               | 7.8                  |
| 2023-10-26 10:50:20 UTC | 108       | true           | 15.3              | 15.3                 |
| 2023-10-26 11:00:10 UTC | 110       | true           | 60.0              | 60.0                 |

### Example 3: last\_value() with a fixed window (current row to end)

**Goal**: Retrieve the duration\_seconds from the last event in a window starting from the current row and extending to the end of the partition.

**XQL Code**:

```sql

config timeframe = 1d
| dataset = sample_xql_raw
| fields event_id, _time, is_successful, duration_seconds
| windowcomp last_value(duration_seconds) by is_successful sort asc _time between 0 and null as last_duration_from_current
| sort asc is_successful, asc _time, asc event_id
| limit 10
```

**Explanation**: You define a window of between 0 and null (current row to the end of the partition). For any given row, the "last" element within this window is always the last element of the entire partition. This produces the same result as Example 1.

**Output**:

| \_time                  | event\_id | is\_successful | duration\_seconds | last\_duration\_from\_current |
| ----------------------- | --------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 2023-10-26 10:05:30 UTC | 102       | false          | 0.8               | 0.05                          |
| 2023-10-26 10:40:10 UTC | 106       | false          | 2.1               | 0.05                          |
| 2023-10-26 10:55:55 UTC | 109       | false          | 0.05              | 0.05                          |
| 2023-10-26 10:00:00 UTC | 101       | true           | 1.5               | 60.0                          |
| 2023-10-26 10:15:15 UTC | 103       | true           | 10.2              | 60.0                          |
| 2023-10-26 10:20:00 UTC | 104       | true           | 0.1               | 60.0                          |
| 2023-10-26 10:30:45 UTC | 105       | true           | 5.0               | 60.0                          |
| 2023-10-26 10:45:00 UTC | 107       | true           | 7.8               | 60.0                          |
| 2023-10-26 10:50:20 UTC | 108       | true           | 15.3              | 60.0                          |
| 2023-10-26 11:00:10 UTC | 110       | true           | 60.0              | 60.0                          |
