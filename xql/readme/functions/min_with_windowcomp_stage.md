# min (windowcomp)

Use the `min()` function within the `windowcomp` stage to compute the minimum value of a specified field over a window of rows. Unlike the `comp` stage version, the `windowcomp` version preserves all original rows and adds the computed minimum as a new field. This is equivalent to `MIN() OVER(...)` in SQL.

## Syntax

```sql
| windowcomp min(<field>) [by <partition_field1>, <partition_field2>, ...] [sort [asc|desc] <sort_field1>, ...] [between <lower> [and <upper>] [frame_type=rows|range]] [as <alias>]
```

## Parameters

| Name              | Type                         | Required | Description                                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `field`           | numeric, string, or datetime | Yes      | The field from which to compute the minimum value.                                                                    |
| `partition_field` | any                          | No       | One or more fields to partition the data by (equivalent to SQL `PARTITION BY`).                                       |
| `sort_field`      | any                          | No       | One or more fields to define the order within each partition (equivalent to SQL `ORDER BY`). Defaults to ascending.   |
| `lower`           | integer or `null`            | No       | Lower bound of the window frame. `0` = current row, negative = rows before, `null` = unbounded.                       |
| `upper`           | integer or `null`            | No       | Upper bound of the window frame. `0` = current row, positive = rows after, `null` = unbounded.                        |
| `frame_type`      | `rows` or `range`            | No       | Type of window frame. `rows` (default) uses physical row offsets; `range` uses value-based offsets on the sort field. |
| `alias`           | string                       | No       | An alias for the output field.                                                                                        |

## Returns

**Type**: same as input field

**Description**: The `min()` function returns the minimum value within the defined window for each row. All original rows are preserved.

## Usage notes

* **Row preservation**: Unlike `comp min()`, the `windowcomp min()` does not reduce the number of rows. Each row retains its original data and gets an additional field with the window minimum.
* **No partitioning**: If no `by` clause is specified, the window spans the entire result set.
* **Default frame**: If no window frame is specified, the default frame is from the start of the partition to the current row (`between null and 0`).
* **Null handling**: NULL values are ignored in the computation.
* **Running minimum**: Can be combined with `sort` to compute running minimums.

## Examples

### Example 1: Minimum severity per host (all rows preserved)

**Goal**: Compute the minimum alert severity for each host while preserving all original rows.

**XQL code**:

```sql
dataset = xdr_data
| windowcomp min(alert_severity) by agent_hostname as min_severity_per_host
```

**Explanation**: The `min()` function computes the minimum `alert_severity` within each `agent_hostname` partition. All original rows are preserved, and each row receives the partition's minimum value in `min_severity_per_host`.

**Output**:

| \_TIME              | AGENT\_HOSTNAME | ALERT\_SEVERITY | MIN\_SEVERITY\_PER\_HOST |
| ------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| 2024-01-15 08:00:00 | workstation-1   | 3               | 3                        |
| 2024-01-15 09:00:00 | workstation-1   | 7               | 3                        |
| 2024-01-15 10:00:00 | workstation-1   | 5               | 3                        |
| 2024-01-15 08:30:00 | workstation-2   | 2               | 2                        |
| 2024-01-15 09:30:00 | workstation-2   | 4               | 2                        |

### Example 2: Running minimum over time

**Goal**: Compute a running minimum of bytes received, ordered by time.

**XQL code**:

```sql
dataset = xdr_data
| windowcomp min(action_network_bytes_received) sort asc _time as running_min_bytes
```

**Explanation**: By sorting on `_time` in ascending order, the `min()` function computes a running minimum of `action_network_bytes_received` from the start of the dataset up to the current row.

**Output**:

| \_TIME              | ACTION\_NETWORK\_BYTES\_RECEIVED | RUNNING\_MIN\_BYTES |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 2024-01-15 08:00:00 | 500                              | 500                 |
| 2024-01-15 09:00:00 | 250                              | 250                 |
| 2024-01-15 10:00:00 | 400                              | 250                 |
| 2024-01-15 11:00:00 | 100                              | 100                 |

### Example 3: Minimum within a sliding window of 3 rows

**Goal**: Compute the minimum bytes received within a sliding window of 3 rows (current row plus one row before and one row after).

**XQL code**:

```sql
dataset = xdr_data
| windowcomp min(action_network_bytes_received) sort asc _time between -1 and 1 as local_min
```

**Explanation**: The `between -1 and 1` clause defines a sliding window of 3 rows centered on the current row. The `min()` function returns the minimum `action_network_bytes_received` value within that window for each row.

**Output**:

| \_TIME              | ACTION\_NETWORK\_BYTES\_RECEIVED | LOCAL\_MIN |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------- |
| 2024-01-15 08:00:00 | 500                              | 250        |
| 2024-01-15 09:00:00 | 250                              | 250        |
| 2024-01-15 10:00:00 | 400                              | 100        |
| 2024-01-15 11:00:00 | 100                              | 100        |
