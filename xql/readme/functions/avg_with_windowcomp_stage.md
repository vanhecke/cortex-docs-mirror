# avg (windowcomp)

Use the avg() function within the `windowcomp` stage to calculate and return a single average value of a specified numerical field over a defined "window" or group of rows. The resulting average value is then presented for each row within that window frame, allowing for contextual statistical analysis without collapsing rows.

## Syntax

```sql
windowcomp avg(<field>) [by <field> [,<field>,...]] [sort [asc|desc] <field1> [, [asc|desc] <field2>,...]] [between 0|null|<number>|-<number> [and 0|null|<number>|-<number>] [frame_type=range]] [as <alias>] 
```

## Parameters

| Name           | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| field          | numeric | Yes      | The numerical field for which the average will be calculated.                                                                   |
| by field       | string  | No       | Partitions the data into distinct groups, allowing the avg() function to operate independently within each of these partitions. |
| sort field     | string  | No       | Defines the order of rows within each partition. This ordering is critical when defining a window using the between clause.     |
| between clause | string  | No       | Defines the "window frame"—a specific range of rows relative to the current row—over which the avg() function calculates.       |
| alias          | string  | No       | Assigns an alias name to the new column displaying the result.                                                                  |

## Returns

The avg() function returns a single numerical value representing the average for the defined window. This value is displayed in a new column for every row in the group of rows it applies to.

## Usage Notes

* The windowcomp stage must always precede analytic functions like avg() that calculate statistics.
* Only one function can be defined per field within a single windowcomp stage.
* If the between clause is omitted, the default window typically encompasses the entire partition.

## Examples

### Example 1: avg() over an entire partition (default window)

**Goal**: Calculate the average of duration\_seconds for all events within each is\_successful group (partition), and replicate this single average value for every row in that group.

**XQL Code**:

```sql
config timeframe = 1d   
| dataset = sample_xql_raw   
| fields event_id, _time, is_successful, duration_seconds   
| windowcomp avg(duration_seconds) by is_successful as avg_in_partition   
| sort asc is_successful, asc _time, asc event_id   
| limit 10
```

**Explanation**: The `by is_successful` clause partitions the data into two groups: one for false and one for true. The avg() function then calculates the average of the duration\_seconds field for each partition. The result is a single average value for each partition, which is then displayed for every row in that partition. The sort clause ensures the rows are ordered by is\_successful,\_time, and event\_id for consistent presentation of the data.

**Output**:

| \_time                  | event\_id | is\_successful | duration\_seconds | avg\_in\_partition |
| ----------------------- | --------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| 2023-10-26 10:05:30 UTC | 102       | false          | 0.8               | 0.9833             |
| 2023-10-26 10:40:10 UTC | 106       | false          | 2.1               | 0.9833             |
| 2023-10-26 10:55:55 UTC | 109       | false          | 0.05              | 0.9833             |
| 2023-10-26 10:00:00 UTC | 101       | true           | 1.5               | 14.2714            |
| 2023-10-26 10:15:15 UTC | 103       | true           | 10.2              | 14.2714            |
| 2023-10-26 10:20:00 UTC | 104       | true           | 0.1               | 14.2714            |
| 2023-10-26 10:30:45 UTC | 105       | true           | 5.0               | 14.2714            |
| 2023-10-26 10:45:00 UTC | 107       | true           | 7.8               | 14.2714            |
| 2023-10-26 10:50:20 UTC | 108       | true           | 15.3              | 14.2714            |
| 2023-10-26 11:00:10 UTC | 110       | true           | 60.0              | 14.2714            |

### Example 2: avg() with a rolling window (preceding 2 rows and current row)\*\*

**Goal**: Calculate a rolling average from the duration\_seconds of the current row and the two immediately preceding rows within its partition, ordered by \_time.

**XQL Code**:

```sql
config timeframe = 1d   
| dataset = sample_xql_raw   
| fields event_id, _time, is_successful, duration_seconds   
| windowcomp avg(duration_seconds) by is_successful sort asc _time between -2 and 0 as rolling_avg   
| sort asc is_successful, asc _time, asc event_id   
| limit 10
```

**Explanation**: The code defines a rolling window using between -2 and 0 which includes the current row (0) and the two immediately preceding rows (-2, -1) within its partition. For each row, the avg() function calculates the average of duration\_seconds strictly within this rolling window. If there are not enough preceding rows, the window starts from the beginning of the partition.

**Output**:

| \_time                  | event\_id | is\_successful | duration\_seconds | rolling\_avg |
| ----------------------- | --------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| 2023-10-26 10:05:30 UTC | 102       | false          | 0.8               | 0.8          |
| 2023-10-26 10:40:10 UTC | 106       | false          | 2.1               | 1.45         |
| 2023-10-26 10:55:55 UTC | 109       | false          | 0.05              | 0.9833       |
| 2023-10-26 10:00:00 UTC | 101       | true           | 1.5               | 1.5          |
| 2023-10-26 10:15:15 UTC | 103       | true           | 10.2              | 5.85         |
| 2023-10-26 10:20:00 UTC | 104       | true           | 0.1               | 3.9333       |
| 2023-10-26 10:30:45 UTC | 105       | true           | 5.0               | 5.1          |
| 2023-10-26 10:45:00 UTC | 107       | true           | 7.8               | 4.3          |
| 2023-10-26 10:50:20 UTC | 108       | true           | 15.3              | 9.3667       |
| 2023-10-26 11:00:10 UTC | 110       | true           | 60.0              | 27.7         |

### Example 3: avg() with a fixed window (current row to unbounded following row)

**Goal**: Calculate the average for each row over a window that starts from the current row and extends to the end of its partition.

**XQL Code**:

```sql
config timeframe = 1d   
| dataset = sample_xql_raw   
| fields event_id, _time, is_successful, duration_seconds   
| windowcomp avg(duration_seconds) by is_successful sort asc _time between 0 and null as avg_from_current   
| sort asc is_successful, asc _time, asc event_id   
| limit 10
```

**Explanation**: The code uses the `between 0 and null` clause to set a window starting from the current row (0) through to the very end of the partition (null). For each row, the avg() calculates the average of duration\_seconds utilizing the current row's value up to the last value in its is\_successful partition.

**Output**:

| \_time                  | event\_id | is\_successful | duration\_seconds | avg\_from\_current |
| ----------------------- | --------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| 2023-10-26 10:05:30 UTC | 102       | false          | 0.8               | 0.9833             |
| 2023-10-26 10:40:10 UTC | 106       | false          | 2.1               | 1.075              |
| 2023-10-26 10:55:55 UTC | 109       | false          | 0.05              | 0.05               |
| 2023-10-26 10:00:00 UTC | 101       | true           | 1.5               | 14.2714            |
| 2023-10-26 10:15:15 UTC | 103       | true           | 10.2              | 16.4               |
| 2023-10-26 10:20:00 UTC | 104       | true           | 0.1               | 17.64              |
| 2023-10-26 10:30:45 UTC | 105       | true           | 5.0               | 22.025             |
| 2023-10-26 10:45:00 UTC | 107       | true           | 7.8               | 27.7               |
| 2023-10-26 10:50:20 UTC | 108       | true           | 15.3              | 37.65              |
| 2023-10-26 11:00:10 UTC | 110       | true           | 60.0              | 60.0               |
