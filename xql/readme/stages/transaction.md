# transaction

Use the `transaction` stage to group related events into logical sequences or "transactions" based on specified fields. This stage aggregates all fields from the individual events into JSON string arrays and calculates summary statistics for each sequence, such as duration and event count.

## Syntax

```sql
transaction <field_1>, <field_2>, ... [span = <time> [timeshift = <epoch time> [timezone = "<time zone>"]] | startswith = <condition> endswith = <condition> [allowunclosed = true|false]] [maxevents = <number>]
```

## Parameters

| Name            | Type               | Required | Description                                                                          |
| --------------- | ------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `field_n`       | string             | Yes      | One or more fields used to define the groups for the transaction.                    |
| `span`          | string             | No       | Sets a maximum time frame for each transaction (for example, `30m`, `1h`).           |
| `timeshift`     | integer            | No       | Defines a specific start time (epoch) for grouping events when using `span`.         |
| `timezone`      | string             | No       | Defines the time zone for the `timeshift` parameter (for example, `"+00:00"`).       |
| `startswith`    | boolean expression | No       | A condition defining the event that starts a transaction.                            |
| `endswith`      | boolean expression | No       | A condition defining the event that ends a transaction.                              |
| `allowunclosed` | boolean            | No       | If `true` (default), includes transactions that do not have a matching ending event. |
| `maxevents`     | integer            | No       | Defines the maximum number of events to include per transaction. The default is 100. |

## Returns

The `transaction` stage returns aggregated records representing the grouped sequences. All original fields from the grouped events are aggregated into JSON string arrays.

Additionally, the stage appends the following system fields to each transaction record:

* `_start_time`: The timestamp of the first event in the transaction.
* `_end_time`: The timestamp of the last event in the transaction.
* `_duration`: The difference in seconds between the start and end timestamps.
* `_num_of_rows`: The count of events included in the transaction.
* `_transaction_id`: A unique identifier for the transaction.

## Usage notes

* The `transaction` stage aggregates all fields in a JSON string array based on the transaction fields.
* A maximum of 50 fields can be aggregated in a single `transaction` stage.
* Transaction operations can be resource-intensive, especially on large datasets. To optimize performance, apply `filter` stages as early as possible to reduce the dataset size before the `transaction` stage processes records.
* Use the `fields` stage immediately after initial filtering to select only the necessary columns, minimizing the data footprint passed to the transaction stage.
* When using `allowunclosed = true` (the default), a transaction that does not find a matching ending event will define its last event as 12 hours after the starting event.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic transaction grouping

**Goal**: Group events into transactions based on identical values in the `event_id` and `event_description` fields.

**XQL code**:

```sql
config timeframe = 1d
| dataset = sample_xql_raw
| transaction event_id, event_description
| limit 5
```

**Explanation**: This query groups rows that share identical values for both `event_id` and `event_description` into a single transaction. Since these fields are unique in the sample data, each row forms its own transaction.

**Output**:

| EVENT\_ID | EVENT\_DESCRIPTION      | \_START\_TIME           | \_END\_TIME             | \_DURATION | \_NUM\_OF\_ROWS | \_TRANSACTION\_ID |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| 101       | "User login successful" | 2023-10-26 10:00:00 UTC | 2023-10-26 10:00:00 UTC | 0          | 1               | ...               |
| 102       | "File access attempt"   | 2023-10-26 10:05:30 UTC | 2023-10-26 10:05:30 UTC | 0          | 1               | ...               |

### Example 2: Transaction with time span

**Goal**: Group successful events into transactions that occur within a 1-hour time window.

**XQL code**:

```sql
config timeframe = 1d
| dataset = sample_xql_raw
| filter is_successful = true
| transaction is_successful span=1h
| limit 5
```

**Explanation**: The query filters for successful events and then groups them into a single transaction if they occur within the specified 1-hour `span`. In the sample data, multiple successful events fall within this window.

**Output**:

| IS\_SUCCESSFUL | \_START\_TIME           | \_END\_TIME             | \_DURATION | \_NUM\_OF\_ROWS | \_TRANSACTION\_ID |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| true           | 2023-10-26 10:00:00 UTC | 2023-10-26 11:00:10 UTC | \~3610     | 7               | ...               |

### Example 3: Transaction with timeshift and timezone

**Goal**: Group successful events within 30-minute windows, aligned to a specific start time and timezone.

**XQL code**:

```sql
config timeframe = 1d
| dataset = sample_xql_raw
| transaction is_successful span=30m timeshift=1698304800 timezone="+00:00"
| limit 5
```

**Explanation**: This query groups events by `is_successful` into 30-minute windows. The windows are calculated relative to the `timeshift` epoch (corresponding to 2023-10-26 10:00:00 UTC).

**Output**:

| IS\_SUCCESSFUL | \_START\_TIME           | \_END\_TIME             | \_DURATION | \_NUM\_OF\_ROWS | \_TRANSACTION\_ID |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| true           | 2023-10-26 10:00:00 UTC | 2023-10-26 10:30:45 UTC | \~1845     | 4               | ...               |
| true           | 2023-10-26 10:45:00 UTC | 2023-10-26 11:00:10 UTC | \~910      | 3               | ...               |
| false          | 2023-10-26 10:05:30 UTC | 2023-10-26 10:05:30 UTC | 0          | 1               | ...               |
| false          | 2023-10-26 10:40:10 UTC | 2023-10-26 10:55:55 UTC | \~945      | 2               | ...               |

### Example 4: Transaction with start and end conditions

**Goal**: Identify transactions that begin with a log entry containing "User" and end with one containing "S3".

**XQL code**:

```sql
config timeframe = 1d
| dataset = sample_xql_raw
| transaction raw_log_data startswith="User" endswith="S3"
| limit 5
```

**Explanation**: The query groups events based on the `raw_log_data` field. A transaction starts when a value contains "User" and ends when a value contains "S3".

**Output**:

| RAW\_LOG\_DATA                     | \_START\_TIME           | \_END\_TIME             | \_DURATION | \_NUM\_OF\_ROWS | \_TRANSACTION\_ID |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| "User Alice logged in..."          | 2023-10-26 10:00:00 UTC | 2023-10-26 10:00:00 UTC | 0          | 1               | ...               |
| "Full backup of prod\_db to S3..." | 2023-10-26 11:00:10 UTC | 2023-10-26 11:00:10 UTC | 0          | 1               | ...               |

### Example 5: Transaction with max events limit

**Goal**: Group events by success status but strictly limit each transaction to a single event.

**XQL code**:

```sql
config timeframe = 1d
| dataset = sample_xql_raw
| transaction is_successful maxevents=1
| limit 5
```

**Explanation**: By setting `maxevents=1`, the query forces every event into its own distinct transaction, regardless of whether they share the same `is_successful` status or fall within a time span.

**Output**:

| IS\_SUCCESSFUL | \_START\_TIME           | \_END\_TIME             | \_DURATION | \_NUM\_OF\_ROWS | \_TRANSACTION\_ID |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| true           | 2023-10-26 10:00:00 UTC | 2023-10-26 10:00:00 UTC | 0          | 1               | ...               |
| false          | 2023-10-26 10:05:30 UTC | 2023-10-26 10:05:30 UTC | 0          | 1               | ...               |
| true           | 2023-10-26 10:15:15 UTC | 2023-10-26 10:15:15 UTC | 0          | 1               | ...               |
