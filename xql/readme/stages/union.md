# union

Use the `union` stage to combine the result sets of two queries into a single, unified result set. The stage is invaluable for consolidating data from different sources or different filtered views of the same data.

## Syntax

```sql
union <datasetname>
union (<inner xql query>)
```

## Parameters

| Name              | Type        | Required            | Description                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `datasetname`     | string      | Yes (Alternative 1) | The name of the existing dataset to combine with the current query's result set.                          |
| `inner xql query` | query block | Yes (Alternative 2) | An inner XQL subquery defined inline, whose results will be combined with the current query's result set. |

## Returns

The `union` stage returns a single combined result set containing rows from both the parent query and the joined source (dataset or subquery). All fields from both sources become available to subsequent stages.

## Usage notes

* The `union` stage does **not** preserve sort order.
* If a specific order is required for the final output after the union, you must place a `sort` stage **after** the `union` stage.
* Combining datasets can be resource-intensive, similar to `join` operations.
* Always apply `filter` stages as early as possible in your queries to reduce the amount of data being processed **before** the `union` stage.
* Utilize the `fields` stage early to select only necessary columns, minimizing data processing.
* For very large datasets or complex operations, consider breaking a single, long-running query into multiple smaller queries and potentially saving intermediate results to a new dataset using the `target` stage.

## Examples

### Example 1: Union with a named dataset

**Goal**: Combines events from the `sample_xql_raw` dataset that match "File access attempt" with a conceptually created `successful_logins` dataset (containing "User login successful" events).

**XQL code**:

```sql
dataset = sample_xql_raw
| filter event_description = "File access attempt"
| fields event_id, event_description, is_successful
| union successful_logins // Assumes 'successful_logins' dataset exists
```

**Explanation**: The query filters the current dataset for file access attempts and then uses `union` to combine these results with all records from the existing `successful_logins` dataset.

**Output**:

| event\_id | event\_description    | is\_successful |
| --------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| 102       | File access attempt   | false          |
| 101       | User login successful | true           |

### Example 2: Union with an Inner XQL Query

**Goal**: Combines records from `sample_xql_raw` where `is_successful` is false with records where `duration_seconds` is greater than 10.0, derived from a separate inner subquery.

**XQL code**:

```sql
dataset = sample_xql_raw
| filter is_successful = false
| fields event_id, event_description, is_successful, duration_seconds
| union (
    dataset = sample_xql_raw
    | filter duration_seconds > 10.0
    | fields event_id, event_description, is_successful, duration_seconds
)
```

**Explanation**: The main query retrieves unsuccessful events. The `union` stage executes an inner subquery to retrieve events with a duration greater than 10.0 seconds. The results of both queries are combined into a single output.

**Output**:

| event\_id | event\_description             | is\_successful | duration\_seconds |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | -------------- | ----------------- |
| 102       | File access attempt            | false          | 0.8               |
| 106       | Unauthorized access detected   | false          | 2.1               |
| 109       | API request throttled          | false          | 0.05              |
| 103       | Network connection established | true           | 10.2              |
| 108       | Software update initiated      | true           | 15.3              |
| 110       | Database backup completed      | true           | 60.0              |
