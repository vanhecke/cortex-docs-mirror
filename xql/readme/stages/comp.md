# comp

Use the `comp` stage (short for computation) to perform aggregation functions on your dataset. This stage groups records based on specified fields and calculates summary statistics�such as counts, averages, or sums�for each group. The stage is essential for transforming raw event data into meaningful metrics and trends.

## Syntax

```sql
comp <function1>(<field1>) [as <alias1>], [<function2>(<field2>) [as <alias2>], ...] by <group_field1> [, <group_field2>, ...]

```

## Parameters

| Name          | Type     | Required | Description                                                                                                              |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `function`    | function | Yes      | The aggregation function to apply (for example, `count`, `sum`, `avg`, `max`, `min`, `values`).                          |
| `field`       | string   | Yes      | The name of the field to be aggregated.                                                                                  |
| `alias`       | string   | No       | An optional name for the resulting aggregated field. If omitted, a default name is generated (usually `function_field`). |
| `group_field` | string   | Yes      | The field(s) used to group the results. All records with the same value in the `group_field` are calculated together.    |

## Returns

The `comp` stage returns a summary dataset where each row represents a unique combination of the `by` (grouping) fields. The columns include the grouping fields and the results of the aggregation functions. All other original fields are discarded.

## Usage notes

* The `comp` stage is a "blocking" operation; it must process all input records before producing any output.
* Common aggregation functions include `count`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `count_distinct`, and `values`.
* You can group by multiple fields (for example, `by user, host`), which creates a separate row for every unique pair of user and host.
* It is highly recommended to provide an alias (using `as`) for aggregated columns to make the output readable and easier to reference in later stages.
* If you need to group by time, consider using the `bin` stage on a timestamp field before the `comp` stage.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Counting

**Goal**: Count the number of events associated with each user. **XQL code**:

```sql
config timeframe = 1d
| dataset = sample_xql_raw
| comp count(event_id) as total_events by user_name
| fields user_name, total_events

```

**Explanation**: This query groups all records by `user_name` and counts the number of `event_id`s for each user, storing the result in `total_events`. **Output:**

| user\_name | total\_events |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| alice      | 150           |
| bob        | 42            |
| charlie    | 5             |

### Example 2: Multiple Aggregations

**Goal**: Find the first and last occurrence of an event for each IP address. **XQL code**:

```sql
config timeframe = 1d
| dataset = sample_xql_raw
| comp min(_time) as first_seen, max(_time) as last_seen by src_ip
| fields src_ip, first_seen, last_seen

```

**Explanation**: Grouping by `src_ip`, the query calculates the minimum (earliest) timestamp and maximum (latest) timestamp for each IP address. **Output:**

| src\_ip     | first\_seen         | last\_seen          |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| 192.168.1.5 | 2023-10-26 08:00:00 | 2023-10-26 17:30:00 |
| 10.0.0.42   | 2023-10-26 09:15:00 | 2023-10-26 09:20:00 |

### Example 3: Grouping by Time (after Binning)

**Goal**: Count the number of failed logins per hour. **XQL code**:

```sql
config timeframe = 1d
| dataset = sample_xql_raw
| filter event_type = "login_failed"
| bin _time span = 1h
| comp count(event_id) as failure_count by _time
| fields _time, failure_count

```

**Explanation**: The `bin` stage buckets the timestamps into 1-hour intervals. The `comp` stage then groups by these 1-hour buckets to count the failed login events. **Output:**

| \_time              | failure\_count |
| ------------------- | -------------- |
| 2023-10-26 10:00:00 | 12             |
| 2023-10-26 11:00:00 | 8              |
| 2023-10-26 12:00:00 | 25             |

### Example 4: Collecting Unique Values

**Goal**: List all unique applications used by each host. **XQL code**:

```sql
config timeframe = 1d
| dataset = sample_xql_raw
| comp values(app_name) as distinct_apps by host_name
| fields host_name, distinct_apps

```

**Explanation**: The `values` function collects a list of all unique `app_name` entries for each `host_name`. **Output:**

| host\_name | distinct\_apps              |
| ---------- | --------------------------- |
| server-01  | \["nginx", "ssh", "python"] |
| laptop-99  | \["chrome", "slack"]        |
