# bin

Use the `bin` stage to discretize a continuous numerical field or timestamp into separate buckets, or "bins." This is commonly used to group data into ranges, like age groups or time intervals, for aggregation and analysis.

## Syntax

You can add the `bin` stage to your queries using two different formats, depending on whether you are grouping events by quantity or by time span.

**Quantity**:

```sql
bin <field_name> bins=<number>
```

**Time span**:

```sql
bin <field_name> span=<number><timescale> [timeshift=<epoch time> [timezone="<time zone>"]]
```

## Parameters

| Name         | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `field_name` | string | Yes      | The name of the numeric or timestamp field to be binned. When grouping by quantity, the field must be a number. When grouping by time, the field must be a date type. Otherwise, the query fails.                                                                                                                     |
| `bins`       | number | No       | The maximum number of bins to divide the data into. Instead of specifying a fixed bin size with `span`, use `bins` to let the stage automatically calculate an appropriate bin size so that the values are distributed across (at most) the specified number of bins. Provide either `span` or `bins`, but not both.  |
| `span`       | string | No       | The size of each bin. For timestamps, this is a number followed by a timescale suffix (for example, `1h`, `15m`, `1d`). See [Time suffixes](#time-suffixes) for the list of supported suffixes. For numeric fields, this is an integer representing the interval size. Provide either `span` or `bins`, but not both. |
| `timeshift`  | number | No       | A start time for grouping the events, expressed as a Unix epoch time. Use with `span` when binning by time. If not set, the query runs according to the last time set in the log.                                                                                                                                     |
| `timezone`   | string | No       | The time zone applied when grouping events by time. Configure it using an hours offset, such as `"+08:00"`, or using a time zone name from the List of Supported Time Zones, such as `"America/Chicago"`. Optionally used together with `timeshift`.                                                                  |

## Time suffixes

When binning by time span, `<span>` is a combination of a number and one of the following time suffixes. The time suffix is not case sensitive.

| Time suffix | Description  |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| `MS`        | milliseconds |
| `S`         | seconds      |
| `M`         | minutes      |
| `H`         | hours        |
| `D`         | days         |
| `W`         | weeks        |
| `MO`        | months       |
| `Y`         | years        |

## Returns

The `bin` stage modifies the specified field in the dataset, replacing the original continuous values with the starting value of the bin interval they fall into. The resulting field retains its original name.

## Usage notes

* The `bin` stage is often used immediately before an aggregation stage like `comp` to group records by time or numeric ranges. The most common use case is for timecharts.
* Binning simplifies complex continuous data by separating it into manageable categories.
* When binning timestamps, the returned value is the start time of the interval. For example, with `span=1h`, a timestamp of `10:45` becomes `10:00`.
* The `span` parameter determines the granularity of the groups.
* You must specify either `span` or `bins`, but not both. Use `span` when you know the exact bin size you want, and use `bins` when you want a specific number of buckets and want the stage to determine the bin size automatically.
* When you use `bins`, the stage calculates a bin size that distributes the values across at most the specified number of bins, so the actual number of populated bins can be fewer.
* When you group events by quantity, the binned field must be a number. When you group events by time, the binned field must be a date type. Otherwise, the query fails.
* The `bin` stage is only supported using the equal sign (`=`) operator, without any boolean operators (`and`, `or`).
* Use the optional `timeshift` parameter to define a start time for grouping the events according to the Unix epoch time, and use the optional `timezone` parameter to apply a specific time zone. If neither is set, the query runs according to the last time set in the log.

## Examples

### Example 1: Binning by time

**Goal**: Group events into 1-hour intervals to prepare for counting events per hour.

**XQL code**:

```sql
config timeframe = 1d
| dataset = sample_xql_raw
| bin _time span = 1h
| comp count(event_id) as events_per_hour by _time
| fields _time, events_per_hour
```

**Explanation**: The `_time` field is binned into 1-hour buckets. The `comp` stage then counts the number of events that fall into each hour, creating a timeline of activity.

**Output:**

| \_time              | events\_per\_hour |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| 2023-10-26 10:00:00 | 45                |
| 2023-10-26 11:00:00 | 32                |
| 2023-10-26 12:00:00 | 50                |

### Example 2: Binning numeric values

**Goal**: Group file sizes into buckets of 100MB to analyze the distribution of file sizes.

**XQL code**:

```sql
config timeframe = 1d
| dataset = sample_xql_raw
| alter file_size_mb = divide(file_size, 1024 * 1024)
| bin file_size_mb span = 100
| comp count(event_id) as file_count by file_size_mb
| fields file_size_mb, file_count
```

**Explanation**: First, file size is converted to megabytes. Then, `bin` groups these sizes into 100MB intervals (0-100, 100-200, etc.). The `comp` stage counts how many files fall into each size range.

**Output:**

| file\_size\_mb | file\_count |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| 0              | 150         |
| 100            | 40          |
| 200            | 12          |

### Example 3: Binning into a fixed number of buckets

**Goal**: Group file sizes into at most 5 buckets without specifying an exact bin size, letting the stage calculate the interval automatically.

**XQL code**:

```sql
config timeframe = 1d
| dataset = sample_xql_raw
| alter file_size_mb = divide(file_size, 1024 * 1024)
| bin file_size_mb bins = 5
| comp count(event_id) as file_count by file_size_mb
| fields file_size_mb, file_count
```

**Explanation**: Instead of defining a fixed interval with `span`, the `bins = 5` parameter instructs the stage to divide the range of `file_size_mb` values into at most 5 buckets, automatically calculating an appropriate bin size. The `comp` stage then counts how many files fall into each bucket.

**Output:**

| file\_size\_mb | file\_count |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| 0              | 120         |
| 50             | 60          |
| 100            | 15          |
| 150            | 5           |
| 200            | 2           |

### Example 4: Binning by time with a time zone offset

**Goal**: Group events into 1-hour intervals starting from a specific epoch time, using a time zone configured with an hours offset.

**XQL code**:

```sql
dataset = xdr_data
| bin _time span = 1h timeshift = 1615353499 timezone = "+08:00"
| limit 1000
```

**Explanation**: The `_time` field is grouped into 1-hour increments starting from the Unix epoch time `1615353499`, applying a time zone offset of `+08:00`. The `limit` stage returns a maximum of 1,000 records.

### Example 5: Binning by time with a time zone name

**Goal**: Group events into 1-hour intervals starting from a specific epoch time, using a named time zone.

**XQL code**:

```sql
dataset = xdr_data
| bin _time span = 1h timeshift = 1615353499 timezone = "America/Los_Angeles"
| limit 1000
```

**Explanation**: The `_time` field is grouped into 1-hour increments starting from the Unix epoch time `1615353499`, applying the `America/Los_Angeles` time zone. The `limit` stage returns a maximum of 1,000 records.
